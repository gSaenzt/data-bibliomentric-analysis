In a liberalized market, this transition relies on generation company investment decisions. These decisions are shaped by both economic and behavioral factors. Agent-based modeling allows the incorporation of both these factors in the description of the investment decision making process. Nevertheless, there are several challenges associated with the design of agent-based models such as the definition of the model structure and its lack of transparency. In this study, we aim to increase the transparency of investment decision making algorithms by shedding light on how implicit assumptions of the price projection methods used in these algorithms impact model results. To achieve this goal, we developed a core long-term agent-based model to assess different investment decision making algorithms from the literature and we introduced a novel price projection method based on optimization modeling. Our results show that investment decisions vary enormously depending on the assumptions and parameters used in investment decision making algorithms. We also found that our proposed price projection method is robust to parametric deviations. Thus, the proposed investment decision making algorithm enables agent-based modelers to mitigate the potential impacts of hidden implicit assumptions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based simulation modeling; Generation expansion planning; Investment decision making algorithms; Optimization modeling",,"Skea, J., Nishioka, S., Policies and practices for a low-carbon society (2008) Clim Policy, 8, pp. S5-S16; Li, F.G.N., Actors behaving badly: Exploring the modelling of non-optimal behaviour in energy transitions (2017) Energy Strateg Rev, 15, pp. 57-71; Li, F.G.N., Trutnevyte, E., Strachan, N., A review of socio-technical energy transition (STET) models (2015) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 100, pp. 290-305; Li, F.G.N., Strachan, N., Modelling energy transitions for climate targets under landscape and actor inertia (2017) Environ Innov SocTransitions, 24, pp. 106-129; Masini, A., Menichetti, E., The impact of behavioural factors in the renewable energy investment decision making process: Conceptual framework and empirical findings (2012) Energy Pol, 40 (1), pp. 28-38; Masini, A., Menichetti, E., Investment decisions in the renewable energy sector: An analysis of non-financial drivers (2013) Technol Forecast Soc Change, 80 (3), pp. 510-524; Bergek, A., Mignon, I., Sundberg, G., Who invests in renewable electricity production?

Traditionally they have been procured by system operators from large conventional power plants, as by-products of the production of energy. This paper discusses the use of markets to procure ancillary services in the face of potentially higher demand for them, caused by rising amounts of intermittent renewable generation. We discuss: The nature of markets for ancillary services; what we really mean by ancillary services; how they are impacted by the rise of distributed generation; how they are currently procured; how they relate to the rest of the electricity system; the current state of evidence on ancillary services markets; whether these markets ever be as competitive as conventional wholesale energy markets, and offer some conclusions. © 2021 International Association for Energy Economics.

In addition, increased penetration of renewables such as wind capacities resulting in decreased market prices, leads to the augmented risk of investing in conventional generations such as thermal technologies, which may hamper generation adequacy. Thus, to meet regulatory goals for adequacy and environmental considerations, regulators should determine investment incentives considering targets for techno-environmental issues and generation investors’ risks. So, this paper presents a bi-level robust regulatory model, in which regulator in the first level designs incentives considering generation companies’ (GENCOs’) investment response to regulatory decisions. In the second level, a robust game-theoretic model is considered to capture interactions between risk-averse GENCOs, facing uncertainties such as rivals’ behavior and nondispatchable generations. The effectiveness of proposed model is demonstrated by IEEE-RTS and ERCOT test systems and the results are compared with those obtained in the deterministic cases. As the results show, capacity payments and feed-in premiums should be coordinately designed to meet regulatory targets for techno-environmental conditions. Besides, more levels of uncertainties lead to designing more levels of investment incentives with respect to the deterministic case. Moreover, the more is the level of GENCOs’ risk-aversion, the more is the cost of designed incentives for promising regulatory targets considering GENCOs’ risk-hedging. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity payment;

The resulting generation mix is therefore sub-optimal if compared to the one that maximizes social welfare. In this paper, an incentive mechanism for a price-capped multi-area energy only market is proposed. The market model is posed as a mixed complementarity problem using the optimality conditions of all the individual players that participate in the multi-area electricity market. The resulting equilibrium problem is solved using a decomposition approach based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. The proposed solution algorithm takes advantage of the multi-area structure of the problem and outperforms state-of-the-art practices for solving these types of problems. © 2020","ADMM; Generation Adequacy; MCP; PATH","Power markets; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Decomposition approach; Equilibrium problem; Generation capacity; Incentive mechanism; Mixed com-plementarity problems; Optimality conditions; Solution algorithms; Investments","Caramanis, M.C., Bohn, R.E., Schweppe, F.C., Optimal spot pricing: practice and theory (1982) IEEE Trans.

This paper proposes an evaluation method to quantitatively calculate the sufficient capacity of each generation unit and the power generation capacity adequacy of the system, so as to reflect the reliability value of generation unit and the level of power generation capacity adequacy of the system. Based on the evaluation method of power generation capacity adequacy and the principle of marginal cost pricing, a guarantee mechanism for power generation capacity adequacy is designed. The capacity price is determined according to the investment of the marginal unit operating during the peak load period of the year, and the compensation capacity is determined by fully considering the actual power generation capacity of the units and the actual demand of the system. All these measures help power generation enterprises recover fixed costs within the planned payback period and ensure the power generation capacity adequacy of the system. Example simulations verify the effectiveness and adaptability of the designed mechanism. © 2020 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","Adequacy evaluation; Adequacy guarantee; Capacity price; Electricity market; Sufficient capacity","Costs; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Power markets; Electricity market reforms; Generation units; Marginal-cost pricing; Power generation capacities; Power generation enterprise; Reliability values; Reliable power supply; Renewable energies; Investments","Technical guide for electric power system security and stability control: GB/T 26399-2011 (2011), 电力系统安全稳定控制技术导则: GB/T 26399-2011[S]. 北京: 中国标准出版社, [S].

With historically high cost structures and low wholesale prices associated with merit order effects, continuity of entry has been reliant on Renewable Portfolio Standards or other policy initiatives such as government-initiated Contracts-for-Differences. But in Australia's National Electricity Market, sharply falling costs of renewables and volatile wholesale market conditions over the period 2017–2020 led to a surprising number of merchant intermittent renewable investments. Adding to the merchant renewable fleet are older wind plants whose inaugural long-dated PPAs recently matured. Rolling over PPAs is possible, but not necessarily optimal. In this article, a merchant gas turbine, merchant wind, and an integrated portfolio comprising both plants are valued in the NEM's South Australian region. Asset valuations reveal surprising results. The modelling sequence shows stand-alone gas turbine valuation metrics suffer from modest levels of missing money, that merchant wind can commit to some level of forward (fixed volume) swap contracts in-spite of intermittent production, but the combined portfolio tightens overall valuation metrics significantly. Above all, the combined portfolio is financially tractable, overcoming the missing money for a gas turbine plant undertaking peaking duties. In a NEM region where intermittent renewable market share exceeds 50%, this suggests the energy-only, real-time gross pool design may yet be deemed suitable vis-à-vis meeting environmental objectives and Resource Adequacy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Merchant renewables; Peaking plant; Power plant valuations","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Gas turbines; Energy-only market; Environmental objectives; Gas turbine plants; National electricity markets; Policy initiatives; Renewable portfolio standard; Whole sale prices; Wholesale markets; Investments; alternative energy; energy market; energy policy; power plant; Australia; South Australia","Abadie, L.M., Operating flexibility at power plants: a market valuation (2015) International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems, 64, pp. 41-49. , Elsevier Ltd; Abadie, L.M., Chamorro, J.M., Valuing flexibility: the case of an integrated gasification combined cycle power plant (2008) Energy Econ., 30 (4), pp. 1850-1881; Anderson, E.J., Hu, X., Winchester, D., Forward contracts in electricity markets: the Australian experience (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (5), pp. 3089-3103; Arango, S., Larsen, E., Cycles in deregulated electricity markets: empirical evidence from two decades (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (5), pp. 2457-2466; Bajo-Buenestado, R., Welfare implications of capacity payments in a price-capped electricity sector: a case study of the Texas market (ERCOT) (2017) Energy Econ., 64, pp. 272-285; Baker, M., Mayfield, E.S., Parsons, J., Alternative models of uncertain commodity prices for use with modern asset (1998) Energy J., 19 (1), pp. 115-148; Batlle, C., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., Design criteria for implementing a capacity mechanism in deregulated electricity markets (2008) Util.

A computable model of the Polish power generation system is developed and employed to analyse the impact of this mechanism. Two scenarios are designed for this study: (i) a reference scenario that reflects the energy-only market and (ii) a capacity market scenario that assumes the implementation of such an instrument. To assess the economic consequences, the following parameters are estimated: (i) annual electricity prices, (ii) Loss Of Load Hours, (iii) Expected Energy Not Served, and only for the capacity market scenario: (iv) market clearing price, (v) total budget of the capacity market, and (vi) increase in electricity price due to the introduction of the capacity market. The findings of the study indicate that the long-term maintenance of the energy-only market results in higher electricity prices when compared to putting a capacity market into operation. Introducing a capacity market enables existing resources to be used effectively without excessive capital expenditure. The methods and conclusions presented in this paper provide valuable findings and policy insights regarding the potential economic consequences of a capacity mechanism in a power system mostly dominated by coal and undergoing an energy transition. © 2020 The Authors","Adequacy policy; Capacity market; Energy modelling; Energy-only market; Generation mix; Market design","Budget control; Coal industry; Costs; Economic and social effects; Capital expenditures; Economic consequences; Electricity prices; Expected energy not served; Long-term maintenances; Loss of load hours; Market Clearing Price; Power generation systems; Commerce; economic impact; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; expenditure; numerical model; policy implementation; power generation; Poland [Central Europe]","ACER, ACER marker monitoring report 2018 (2019) Electricity Wholesale Markets, , https://www.acer.europa.eu/Official_documents/Acts_of_the_Agency/Publication/ACER%20Market%20Monitoring%20Report%202018%20-%20Electricity%20Wholesale%20Markets%20Volume.pdf; ACER, Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms and the Internal Market for Electricity (2013); ARE, S.A., Energy Statistics.

This article examines the validity of both these effects using spot pricing outcomes in South Australia (SA), which has one of the highest VRE penetrations worldwide. We find partial support for these two effects. While extremely low prices have become more frequent over time, extremely high prices have become less frequent. Spot price volatility has risen, consistent with the hypothesis, but not because prices have become more extreme. Furthermore, these findings are observed for prices in all NEM regions, not just SA. Also, reliability has remained high over the past decade despite the MPC remaining constant in real terms. We provide four reasons why higher VRE penetration need not result in more extreme prices and higher MPCs: (i) greater investment in volatility-dampening, reliability-enhancing technologies like storage and interconnectors; (ii) increased contract cover; (iii) more price-responsive demand; and (iv) emergence of additional ancillary service revenues. These findings have implications for the durability of the NEM's energy-only design given expected further increases in VRE penetration rates across the NEM. © 2020 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland","Ancillary services; Energy-only electricity market; Reliability; Variable renewables",,"AEMC, Annual market performance review 2008–09 (2009); AEMC, How digitalisation is changing the NEM: the potential to move to a two-sided market (2019); AEMC, Wholesale demand response mechanism - Second draft determination (2020); AEMC, Mandatory primary frequency response - Rule determination (2020); AEMO, Guide to ancillary services in the national electricity market (2015); AEMO, South Australian electricity report (2018); AEMO, Quarterly energy dynamics Q3 2019 (2019) Quart.

The main goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of a premature coal power plants phase-out on the Italian day-ahead electricity market. For this purpose, two electricity price forecasts, related to different scenarios between 2019 and 2030, and two different hypotheses for the creation of electricity spot price, were compared. The results from the different scenarios show that coal power plants phase-out determines a small variation in electricity price when bid-up is not considered; instead, when operators' bid-up is included in the study, the price variation becomes relevant. © 2020 by the authors.

Our framework incorporates firms with different levels of market power; heterogeneous technologies, including renewables, base load and peak load; time-varying short-term demand and renewable supply; and long-term demand uncertainty. A real options model allows us to obtain technology-specific thresholds for demand to trigger investment. We apply our model to the German power market and show that a doubling of current demand triggers renewable investment, whereas base load generation requires over 50 times current demand on average. The availability of peak load generation serves to avoid rationing and reduce fluctuations in the electricity price. In the absence of incentive mechanisms, however, demand does not become sufficiently high to trigger investment in this technology. We investigate at which level capacity payments to peak power plants prevent rationing without reducing investments in renewables. Furthermore, by accounting for market power, we illustrate that strategic firms do not increase their market shares over time but hold back investment until market prices are sufficiently high for price-taking firms to expand capacity. As a result, the intensity of competition increases over time. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Capacity expansion; Competitive power markets; Energy systems; Real options","Commerce; Competition; Expansion; Power markets; Capacity expansion; Competitive power markets; Energy systems; Heterogeneous technology; Intensity of competition; Peak load generations; Real Options; Real options approach; Investments","Sandbag: The European Power Sector in 2017.

On the supply side, capacity can be supported through a Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM). On the demand side, Demand Response (DR) technologies can be deployed. We find that while all traditional generation should receive the same payment, capacity payments for DR technologies should gradually decrease based on operators’ position in the load-shedding order. We observe that all CRM schemes currently implemented provide inadequate incentives to non-price responsive DR and propose to adjust payments to DR units as a function of their expected activation periods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity remuneration mechanisms; Demand response; Power market design","demand analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; incentive; technology adoption","Aalami, H.A., Moghaddam, M.P., Yousefi, G.R., Demand response modeling considering Interruptible/Curtailable loads and capacity market programs (2010) Applied Energy, 87, pp. 243-250; Adib, P., Schubert, E., Oren, S., Chapter 9: Resource Adequacy: Alternate Perspectives and Divergent Paths (2008); Albadi, M.H., El-Saadany, E.F., A summary of demand response in electricity markets (2008); Astier, N., Lambin, X., Ensuring Capacity Adequacy in Liberalised Electricity Markets (2019) Energy Journal, 40 (3); Astier, N., Léautier, T.-O., Demand Response: Smart Market Designs for Smart Consumers (2016), working paper; Batlle, C., Rodilla, P., A critical assessment of the different approaches aimed to secure electricity generation supply (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (11), pp. 7169-7179; Behrangrad, M., A review of demand side management business models in the electricity market (2015) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 47, pp. 270-283; Borenstein, S., The Trouble With Electricity Markets: Understanding California's Restructuring Disaster (2002) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 16, pp. 191-211; Borenstein, S., The long-run efficiency of real-time electricity pricing (2005) Energy Journal, 26, pp. 93-116; Borenstein, S., Bushnell, J.B., Wolak, F.A., Measuring market inefficiencies in California's restructured wholesale electricity market (2002) American Economic Review, 92, pp. 1376-1405; Borenstein, S., Holland, S., On the efficiency of competitive electricity markets with time-invariant retail prices (2003) The Rand Journal of Economics, 36, pp. 469-493; Brophy Haney, A., Jamasb, T., Pollitt, M.G., Smart Metering and Electricity Demand: Technology, Economics and International Experience (2009) Policy, 44, pp. 1-72; Caramanis, M., Bohn, R., Schweppe, F., Optimal Spot Pricing: Practice and Theory (1982) IEEE Power Engineering Review, PER-, 2, p. 42; Chao, H.-P., Price-Responsive Demand Management for a Smart Grid World (2010) The Electricity Journal, 23, pp. 7-20; Chao, H.-P., Competitive electricity markets with consumer subscription service in a smart grid (2012) Journal of Regulatory Economics, 41, pp. 155-180; Chao, H.-P., Oren, S.S., Smith, S.A., Wilson, R.B., Multilevel demand subscription pricing for electric power (1986) Energy Economics, 8, pp. 199-217; Chao, H.-P., Wilson, R., Priority Service: Pricing, Investment, and Market Organization (1987) The American Economic Review, 77, pp. 899-916; Chen, X., Kleit, A.N., Money for Nothing ?

We evaluate the resource adequacy policy implications of correlated generator failures in the PJM Interconnection by making use of observed temperature-dependent forced outage rates. Correlated failures pose substantial resource adequacy risk, increasing PJM's required reserve margin from 15.9% to 22.9% in the 2018/2019 delivery year. However, PJM actually procured a 26.6% reserve margin in this delivery year, translating to excess capacity payments of $315 million and an implied value of lost load of approximately $700,000/MWh, a figure two orders of magnitude greater than typically used in operational contexts. Capacity requirements vary by month, with more than 95% of loss-of-load risk accruing in July. Setting monthly capacity targets could reduce annual PJM procurement by approximately 16%. We examine the resource adequacy implications of the ongoing replacement of nuclear and coal in PJM with combined-cycle gas generators, finding moderate benefits: approximately a 2% reduction in capacity requirements. We identify modest resource adequacy risks from potential future climate scenarios, modeled as temperature increases of 1 and 2 °C relative to our study period. Holding loads fixed, these scenarios increase capacity requirements by approximately 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Correlated failures; Generating Availability Data System (GADS); Generation planning; Renewable Energy Capacity Planning Model (RECAP); Reserve margins; Resource adequacy; Value of lost load","Availability; Climate change; Climate models; Electric generators; Gas generators; Loss of load probability; Public policy; Risk perception; Correlated failures; Data systems; Generation planning; Renewable energy capacity; Reserve margins; Resource adequacy; Value of lost load; Coal deposits; climate change; electricity generation; numerical model; renewable resource; temperature effect","(2017), https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Reliability%5C%0AStandards/BAL-502-RF-03.pdf, ReliabilityFirst Corporation.

When dealing with irreversibility under uncertainty, deferring decisions to commit in new power plants, waiting for better information, is therefore a rational approach. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that such investment pattern determines the occurrence of construction cycles, which strongly compromise supply security. In order to supplement generators' revenues, several remuneration mechanisms have been devised over past years. Along this line, this work addresses the long-run dynamics of capacity adequacy and market efficiency with both a price-based and a quantity-based capacity remuneration policy. For that purpose, a recently-developed, stochastic simulation model is used as a benchmark. Hence, the optimal postponement of generation investment decisions is integrated into a long-run power market model by formulating the decision-making problem in the framework of Real Options Analysis. Results suggest that policymakers may exchange supply security (effectiveness) for energy prices to be paid by consumers (efficiency) when designing and implementing capacity remuneration mechanisms. By doing so, this article contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the design of incentive policies and efficient power markets by considering the microeconomics of investors’ decision-making under irreversibility and uncertainty. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity markets; Capacity payments; Generation investments; Real options; Supply reliability; System dynamics","Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Power markets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Capacity markets; Capacity payments; Generation investment; Real Options; Supply reliability; System Dynamics; Investments; energy market; investment; microeconomics; price dynamics","Abani, A.O., Hary, N., Rious, V., Saguan, M., The impact of investors' risk aversion on the performances of capacity remuneration mechanisms (2018) Energy Policy, 112, pp. 84-97; Ahmad, S., Tahar, R.M., Muhammad-Sukki, F., Munir, A.B., Rahim, R.A., Application of System Dynamics approach in electricity sector modelling: a review (2016) Renew.

V2X services generate revenue from the battery asset through dynamic (V1X) or bi-directional (V2X) charging to provide benefits to the electric grid, to reduce energy consumption of buildings and homes, or to provide back-up power to loads. While relatively unknown and still regarded as a nascent technology, V2X exhibits low capital costs and enabling costs have decreased by 90% since 2014. We present the V2X Value Stream Framework as a means to better communicate and categorize its full economic potential. A meta-analysis of Value Stream potential gives results contradictory to the literature and indicates that Bill Management, Resource Adequacy, and Network Deferral are more valuable than Energy Arbitrage and Spinning Reserves. We distinguish between Energy and Power Value Streams and show how the latter cause less battery degradation and allow for greater stacking of services. Finally, energy policy recommendations are given to better integrate V2X. While we concur that development is of and by the market, we emphasize that V2X will develop within the constraints of the regulatory environment; therefore regulators have an enabling role to play. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ancillary Services; Distributed Energy Resources (DER); Energy Market Regulation; Vehicle-to-Anything (V2X); Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)","Charging (batteries); Commerce; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Public policy; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Ancillary service; Distributed energy resource; Electric vehicle batteries; Energy markets; Policy recommendations; Reduce energy consumption; Regulatory environment; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Secondary batteries; building; electric vehicle; energy market; energy policy; energy resource; energy use; regulatory framework","AEMO, Quarterly Energy Dynamics - Q4 2018 (2018), Australian Energy Market Operator; Andersen, A.N., Erge, T., Sauer, C., Siewierski, T., Romanovsky, G., Mutale, J., Watts, M., Market Access for Smaller Size Intelligent Electricity Generation (MASSIG) - Critical Survey of Requirements for Market Participation of Small Scale Intelligent Generators (2010); Bishop, J.D.K., Axon, C.J., Bonilla, D., Tran, M., Banister, D., McCulloch, M.D., Evaluating the impact of V2G services on the degradation of batteries in PHEV and EV (2013) Appl.

However, over such long time horizons (20–50 years), these forecasts often prove to be inaccurate. As an example, wrong projections of low natural gas prices and high electricity demand in Europe in the early 2000s stimulated massive investments in electricity generation, which led to the current situation of overcapacity in the European electricity market. In this work, we first present the issue of overcapacity in Europe and discuss its causes; in particular, we highlight the relationship between overcapacity and errors in forecasts of electricity demand and fuel prices. Then, we apply a novel robust optimization framework to a real-world strategic energy planning problem, and compare it to the standard, deterministic decision-making approach. The results show that the robust investment strategies are up to 58% less likely to require future modifications leading to overcapacity. Overall, this suggests that considering uncertainties in the long-term planning process can reduce the risk of generating overcapacity in national power systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity generation; Overcapacity; Power systems; Robust optimization; Strategic energy planning; Uncertainty","Costs; Decision making; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; Investments; Natural gas; Optimization; Standby power systems; Electricity generation; Over capacity; Robust optimization; Strategic energy planning; Uncertainty; Electric power system planning; demand analysis; electricity generation; energy market; energy planning; natural gas; optimization; planning process; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; Europe","Sugiyama, M., Climate change mitigation and electrification (2012) Energy Policy, 44, pp. 464-468; Beveridge, R., Kern, K., The Energiewende in Germany: background, developments and future challenges (2013) Renew Energy Law Policy Rev (RELP), 4, p. 3. , http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/relp2013&id=5&div=&collection=; Moret, S., Babonneau, F., Bierlaire, M., Maréchal, F., Decision support for strategic energy planning: a robust optimization framework (2020) Eur J Oper Res, 280 (2), pp. 539-554; Afful-Dadzie, A., Afful-Dadzie, E., Awudu, I., Banuro, J.K., Power generation capacity planning under budget constraint in developing countries (2017) Appl Energy, 188, pp. 71-82; Wen, F.S., Wu, F.F., Ni, Y.X., Generation capacity adequacy in the competitive electricity market environment (2004) Int J Electr Power Energy Syst, 26 (5), pp. 365-372; Fraser, H., Lo Passo, F., Developing a capacity payment mechanism in Italy (2003) Electr J, 16 (9), pp. 54-58; (2002), pp. 7-12. , https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20020002, de Vries LJ, Hakvoort RA.

In particular, we apply the modeling framework to investigate the impact of high penetration levels of variable renewable energy resources and different market designs on achieving resource adequacy. The model captures the strategic capacity investment and retirement decision-making of profit-maximizing generation companies. In contrast to many previous studies, this paper considers markets for capacity, energy, and reserve products in detail; thus, the modeling framework allows improved analysis of generation expansion and revenue sufficiency in a competitive market environment. The modeling framework is based on Stackelberg leader-follower games and is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, which is then transformed into a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. Furthermore, we employ a Lagrangian decomposition algorithm to enhance computational performance. In a case study of the electric reliability council of texas (ERCOT) system, we compare the results from the proposed model with those obtained from a traditional centralized least-cost planning model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework and highlight the importance of considering strategic behavior in a competitive market framework when assessing resource adequacy. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Behavioral modeling; capacity market; capacity remuneration mechanism; complementarity modeling; generation expansion planning; resource adequacy; variable renewable energy","Behavioral research; Commerce; Decision making; Expansion; Investments; Power markets; Behavioral model; Capacity markets; Complementarity models; Generation expansion planning; Resource adequacy; Variable renewable energies; Renewable energy resources","Hogan, W.W., (2005) On An 'Energy Only' Electricity Market Design for Resource Adequacy, , Harvard Univeristy, Cambridge, MA, Tech.

When a power producer writes a RO, s/he agrees to set a cap on the price of electricity that s/he cashes. In return, the system operator, i.e. the party that is buying the option, pays to the option issuer a fixed premium. In this paper we analyze how ROs affect the timing and value of investments in the energy sector and we show under what conditions they can be used as investment stimuli. We prove that, contrarily to what is expected, ROs can potentially harm the security of supply by delaying the adoption of new capacity and by reducing the value of investing in it. To avoid such a result, a careful setting of the relevant parameters is needed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Electricity markets; Investment analysis; Real options; Reliability options",,"Andreis, L., Flora, M., Fontini, F., Vargiolu, T., Pricing reliability options under different electricity prices’ regimes (2020) Energy Economics, 87, p. 104705; Batlle, C., Mastropietro, P., Rodilla, P., Perez-Arriaga, I.J., The system adequacy problem: lessons learned from the american continent (2015) Chapter of the Book Capacity Mechanisms in the EU Energy Markets: Law, Policy, and Economics, , Oxford University Press; Bhagwat, P.C., Meeus, L., Reliability options: Can they deliver on their promises?

In this context, in this article we propose a novel framework for determining the capacity value of VGTs to contribute to the generation system adequacy, as well as a corresponding method for allocating capacity payments in hydrothermal power systems. We show that the capacity value of VGTs increases with the presence of water reservoirs, since VGTs help relieving hydropower plants from using scarce water resources during off-peak hours thus making more resources available to supply the demand during peak hours. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Water resources; Capacity payments; Generation systems; Hydropower plants; Hydrothermal power systems; Photovoltaic generation; Renewable energies; System reliability; Variable generations; Reservoirs (water)","Energía 2050.

A decrease in the carbon emissions produced by the power plant will result in a tax decrease. In view of this, the Dynamic carbon-constrained Equilibrium programming equilibrium constraints (DCC-EPEC) Framework is suggested to explore the effects of distinct market models on generation development planning (GEP) on electricity markets over a multi-period horizon. The investment incentives included in our model are the firm contract and capacity payment. The investment issue, which is regarded as a set of dominant producers in the oligopolistic market, is developed as an EPEC optimization problem to reduce carbon emissions. In the suggested DCC-EPEC model, the sum of the carbon emission tax and true social welfare are assumed as the objective function. Investment decisions and the strategic behavior of producers are included at the first level so as to maximize the overall profit of the investor over the scheduling period. The second-level issue is market-clearing, which is resolved by an independent system operator (ISO) to maximize social welfare. A real power network, as a case study, is provided to assess the suggested carbon-constrained EPEC framework. Simulations indicate that firm contracts and capacity payments can initiate the capacity expansion of different technologies to improve the long-term stability of the electricity market. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2; Dynamic; Emissions; EPEC; Generation expansion; Investment incentives; Planning","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Dynamics; Electric utilities; Environmental regulations; Expansion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International law; Particulate emissions; Planning; Power markets; Constrained equilibriums; EPEC; Equilibrium constraint; European union emissions trading schemes; Generation expansion; Generation investment; Independent system operators; Investment incentives; Investments","Ghalebani, A., Das, T.K., Design of financial incentive programs to promote net zero energy buildings (2017) IEEE Trans.

The research project is based on the Italian electricity system analysis pointing out the renewables high contribution, the poor domestic users' electrification and the need to figure out those issues by a demand flexibility system implementation. Moreover, the characterization of Italian domestic users' energy loads allowed to identify the suitable strategies to get higher flexibility degree. Thus, three case studies have been considered to assess the achievable economic savings due to the DR implementation, accounting for the revenue for dispatching services as well as the intraday energy price variations on the Italian market. It emerged that the demand side flexibility implementation offers benefits to the Italian electricity system but entails small economic benefits for the end-users. Additionally, the adoption of such a system is quite complicated due to the lack of suitable and reliable automation devices. For that reason, a potential energy aggregator for domestic users will have to search funds for its own operation providing customers with additional services, such as energy saving and assisted-living, by using of ICT along with automation within each dwelling. © 2019 Author(s).",,,"(2017) Impianti di Generazione, , http://www.terna.it/SistemaElettrico/StatisticheePrevisioni/DatiStatistici.aspx, Terna S.p.A.

Argentina was one of the first developing countries to implement the liberalisation and privatisation of public utilities. In 2015, the Argentine electricity market faced a crisis due to low capacity investment. This arose from consumer prices that poorly reflected the true electricity cost, increasing risk for companies to invest in new generation capacity. Since 2016, Argentine government has called an auction to increase generation capacity; in addition, the government has cut incentive to consumers looking for reduce the electricity demand. Moreover, Argentina's government is promoting policies to increase renewable energy share. However, it is unknown how renewable energies may affect security of supply and electricity price. This paper presents a simulation model to analyse policies for increasing generation capacity and promote renewable energy in Argentina. In this paper is concluded that renewable energies do indeed reduce the energy dependency of fossil fuels, and they lead to reduce electricity prices. © 2019 Author(s).",,,"World energy council, (2013) pp 1-100; (2014) Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change, , IPCC, (Cambridge and New York); (2013) World Energy Trilemma Time to Get Real-the Case for Sustainable Energy Investment, , World Energy Council; Moreno, F., Martínez-Val, J.M., (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 6561-6574; Battaglini, A., Lilliestam, J., Haas, A., Patt, A., (2009) J.

Although concerns regarding possible interaction effects between different market designs have been raised occasionally, the scientific research on capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRMs) primarily focusses on different design options in single markets. The research concerning possible spsill-over effects, positive or negative, in adjacent markets is lagging behind. This is the case for the effects of CRMs as well as for the effects of insufficient investment incentives. We address both topics in this paper. Specifically, we analyse the effects of price caps in two interconnected markets. Additionally, we analyse the effects of capacity payments meant to counter the deadweight losses triggered by the price restrictions. Although we find no indication that price caps or capacity payments in one market have (serious) negative effects on neighbouring markets, being connected to other markets can worsen the deadweight losses induced by insufficient investment. Also, capacity mechanisms might be less effective than in isolated markets. Finally, in the analysed set-up we find no indication that efforts to ensure security of supply in one market support neighbouring markets with insufficient investment incentives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity remuneration mechanisms; Cross-border effects; Electricity market design","Commerce; Failure (mechanical); Power markets; Capacity payments; Cross-border; Electricity market design; Insufficient investments; Interaction effect; Market failures; Scientific researches; Security of supply; Investments; electricity; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; investment; price dynamics; Europe","50Hertz, Kennzahlen.

In pool market model, there are issues on the benefit of the generators such as too high system marginal price (SMP) during peak demand and no revenue during low demand. Therefore, conceptual study for two bus test system in MESI involving four generators around Peninsular Malaysia is conducted to perform the economic analysis in term of generation revenue and demand assessment considering existing single buyer model and pool based market model, i.e., pool model, spot market model and the proposed model, in order to identify which market model is superior. As a result, the proposed model managed to decrease the demand payment as it is proportional to generation revenue, even though the generation revenue is at intermediate value and succeed to increase the low and medium generator’s revenue. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

These payments help stabilize generator revenues, making investment in capacity more attractive for risk-averse investors when other outlets for risk trading are limited. Here we develop a heuristic algorithm to solve large-scale stochastic equilibrium models describing a competitive market with incomplete risk trading. Introduction of a capacity mechanism has an asymmetric effect on the risk profile of different generation technologies, tilting the resource mix towards those with lower fixed costs and higher operating costs. One implication of this result is that current market structures may be ill-suited to financing low-carbon resources, the most scalable of which have high fixed costs and near-zero operating costs. Development of new risk trading mechanisms to replace or complement current capacity obligations could lead to more efficient outcomes. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Cost accounting; Electric generators; Heuristic algorithms; Investments; Operating costs; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Asymmetric effects; Competitive markets; Current capacity; Generation technologies; Liberalized electricity market; Market structures; Stochastic equilibrium; Trading mechanism; Commerce; cost analysis; electricity; electricity generation; energy market; fuel; market conditions; resource use; risk assessment","Bushnell, J., Flagg, M., Mansur, E., (2017) Capacity Markets at a Crossroads Working Paper, 278. , Energy Institute at Haas; Oren, S.S., Generation adequacy via call options obligations: safe passage to the promised land (2005) Electricity J., 18, pp. 28-42; Joskow, P., (2007) The New Energy Paradigm, , (ed.

Mainly based on North America's market experience, our proposed design adopts an independent system operator's (ISO's) existing practice of least-cost dispatch of heterogeneous generation units, real-time energy price determination and capacity rationing. It solves the missing money problem of inadequate incentive for thermal generation investment, without requiring the ISO to operate centralized capacity auctions, make capacity payments, set high energy price caps, or subsidize market entry. It preempts independent power producers' price manipulation in the ISO's real-time market for energy, thus easing the ISO's burden of market monitoring. It suggests two-part pricing of end-use consumption and power demand of a load serving entity's retail customers, thus meaningfully linking the wholesale and retail markets. It is applicable to countries that have implemented wholesale competition or are in the process of doing so. Hence, its policy implication is that it should be considered in the ongoing debate of electricity reliability and market competition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity market design; Missing money; Price manipulation; Reliability differentiation; Tolling agreements; Wholesale competition","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Electric industry; Electric utilities; Power markets; Power quality; Public policy; Reliability; Sales; Demand and supply uncertainties; Electricity market design; Independent power producers; Independent system operators; Load serving entities; Missing money; Price manipulation; Wholesale electricity markets; Investments; competition (economics); differentiation; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy policy; policy approach; price dynamics; reliability analysis; North America","Alagappan, L., Orans, R., Woo, C.K., What drives renewable energy development?

Using Ireland's electricity sector as a case study, we highlight multiple challenges in reconciling ambition for variable renewable integration with market economics and system operation. Ireland has the highest share of non-synchronous variable renewable electricity on a single synchronous power system. This case study examines the strategy being implemented to optimally balance between efficiency, flexibility and adequacy while maintaining a fully functional system that strives to adapt to evolving conditions. The transition that the Single Electricity Market underwent to comply with the EU Target Market was a major overhaul of what made the all-island market a success. Volume-based reliability options have distinct advantages over capacity payments. System services are critical for system stability and 14 separate system services are being developed. These actions, when taken together, provide an insight into the lengths to which this electricity market must go to transform from its cost-based nature to a value-based alternative that rewards flexible and reliable capacity with the ability to evolve with market conditions of the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity remuneration mechanism; Electricity market transformation; I-SEM; System services; Target model","Commerce; Electric industry; Power markets; System stability; Electricity sector; Functional systems; Market transformation; Renewable electricity; Renewable integration; System services; Target model; Variable generations; Electric power system economics","Foley, A.M., Ó Gallachóir, B.P., McKeogh, E.J., Milborrow, D., Leahy, P.G., Addressing the technical and market challenges to high wind power integration in Ireland (2013) Renew.

The process of harmonizing the day-ahead markets (DAMs) is at an advanced stage, with an efficiency in the use of interconnectors of 86%. However, the harmonization of both intraday (IDMs) and balancing markets (BMs) is still in its infancy, with an efficiency in the use of interconnectors of 50 and 19%, respectively. The new proposal brings new targets to DAMs, and European countries should make efforts to comply with them. The same is true for IDMs and BMs, but involving more ambitious targets, requiring higher efforts to be accomplished. Both the analysis of the various National markets (according to their compliance with the new proposal for regulating the EIME) and the advantages of the new proposal for key market participants (particularly, consumers, variable renewable generation, and conventional generation) are presented. The analysis indicates that the proposal contributes to a potential increase of the general welfare of market participants. However, some aspects of the proposal can negatively affect the revenue obtained from the National markets, notably for variable renewable generation and conventional generation.

As a result, there is a need for new models to help the industry better utilize resources in a time of increasing uncertainty and to help government policy makers better understand the impacts of their regulatory decisions. We provide a structured review of the operations research and management science literatures to describe the current operational and policy issues in the electric power industry, with a particular focus on issues surrounding electricity market design, renewable integration, effects of climate policy on electric power infrastructure, rise of electric powered vehicles, energy storage, and the growing interdependence between natural gas and electric power sectors. We identify the current research frontier and classify the existing research into clusters with respect to managerial issues addressed. We offer a forecast for where the electric power industry is going and describe some important public policy issues. Finally, we highlight research opportunities and discuss how the management science community can contribute by considering the interaction between operational considerations and electric power policy. © 2019 The Authors.

The market clearing price does not guarantee the economic sustainability of several technologies, which, nevertheless, are needed for the secure operation of the power system. The solutions to cope with this situation do theoretically work well for optimal systems, its application for real-life nonoptimal systems being doubtful. The growing deployment rate of technologies with “near zero” marginal cost and payments outside the market are leading to an intermittent generation excess capacity and the reduction of the market clearing price. Other difficulties should be taken into account in today's markets. The issue is if the remuneration of the power plants should be based solely on the spot market. Through the concepts of optimal power system and nonoptimal power system, it is shown that the missing money problem for some technologies may coincide with the over profit problem for other technologies. As a contribution to discuss further this issue, a solution is proposed based on a short-term energy market complemented with an outside market long-term capacity payment mechanism, grounded on a Power Purchase Agreement set between a central planning agency and the power plant owner. The proposed solution complies with security of supply, environmental sustainability, and producers' economic viability at minimum cost for the consumers. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","capacity markets;

Given the predominance of hydropower and the importance of energy exports in Yunnan, the province presents a challenging case study of electricity market reforms. The experience of and lessons from Yunnan provide a reference for other provinces in China engaged in the growing adoption of renewable energy. The main contributions of this paper lie in the extension of the existing understanding of electricity reforms in Yunnan and China. Based on extensive data previously unreported in the literature, this paper shows how the Yunnan electricity market functions in practice and indicates where the practice is deficient in terms of the theory of how electricity markets should function. Finally, this paper suggests how market reforms should be adopted toward a scientifically designed electricity market. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity market; Hydropower; Reform; Renewable energy; Yunnan","Electric industry; Hydroelectric power; Power markets; Electricity market reforms; Electricity reform; Energy exports; Hydropower; Reform; Renewable energies; Renewable energy integrations; Yunnan; Commerce","Lin, B., Du, K., Energy and CO2 emissions performance in China's regional economies: do market-oriented reforms matter?

We utilise this fact to devise a novel methodology to estimate the contribution of a load-shifting demand response resource to system adequacy. We then simulate an electricity market using mixed complementarity models to determine how the participation of demand response in capacity markets impacts on market outcomes. Demand response primarily affects the equilibrium outcome through the energy market, however demand response also reduces both equilibrium prices and consumer costs through its capacity market contribution. The effect is particularly pronounced when there is a high level of variable renewable generation and initial undercapacity. In the absence of demand response, increased wind generation leads to higher capacity prices as generators seek to offset depressed energy prices. However, we find that demand response's participation in the capacity market can combat these increased capacity prices. These results suggest that demand response participation in capacity markets can mitigate some of the market challenges of renewable integration, particularly that of the “missing money” problem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity; Demand response; Load-shifting; Markets; Reserve","Commerce; Costs; Marketing; Power markets; Capacity; Demand response; Demand response resources; Load shifting; Mixed complementarities; Renewable generation; Renewable integration; Reserve; Investments; critical load; demand analysis; energy market; investment; local participation; power generation","Nolan, S., O'Malley, M., Challenges and barriers to demand response deployment and evaluation (2015) Appl Energy, 152, pp. 1-10. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306261915005462; Eissa, M., Developing incentive demand response with commercial energy management system (cems)based on diffusion model, smart meters and new communication protocol (2019) Appl Energy, 236, pp. 273-292; Mkireb, C., Dembélé, A., Jouglet, A., Denoeux, T., Robust optimization of demand response power bids for drinking water systems (2019) Appl Energy, 238, pp. 1036-1047; Good, N., Using behavioural economic theory in modelling of demand response (2019) Appl Energy, 239, pp. 107-116; Cutter, E., Taylor, A., Kahrl, F., Woo, C.K., Beyond, D.R., (2012), pp. 77-88. , - maximizing the value of responsive load limits of the current DR paradigm.

These so-called capacity mechanisms have a tendency to distort the functioning of the internal market in electricity by restricting cross-border participation. Through a doctrinal legal analysis of the relevant sources of EU law, this article examines the forthcoming legal changes to cross-border participation in capacity mechanisms and the implications of the changing legal setting to Member States' margin of discretion in adopting and designing capacity mechanisms. The article demonstrates how the increasing EU-level harmonisation will effectively prevent Member States' opportunities to limit cross-border participation in their capacity mechanism designs. This will have a significant impact on the way Member States can design their capacity mechanisms in the future. © 2019 IEEE.","Capacity mechanisms; electricity market; EU law; generation adequacy; security of supply; Winter Package","Machine design; Power markets; Economic incentive; European union; Generation adequacy; Generation capacity; Harmonisation; Legal instruments; Mechanism design; Security of supply; Commerce","Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., Stoft, S., Capacity market fundamentals (2013) Economics of Energy & Environmental Policy, 2 (2), pp. 27-46; Newbery, D., Missing money and missing markets: Reliability, capacity auctions and interconnectors"", 94 Energy Policy, 2016, pp. 401-410; Mastropietro, P., Rodilla, P., Batlle, C., National capacity mechanisms in the European internal energy market: Opening the doors to neighbours (2015) Energy Policy, 82, pp. 38-47; Bhagwat, P., Richstein, J., Chappin, E., Iychettira, K., De Vries, L., Cross-border effects of capacity mechanisms in interconnected power systems, 46 Utilities Policy, 2017, pp. 33-47; Hawker, G., Bell, K., Gill, S., Electricity security in the European Union-The conflict between national Capacity Mechanisms and the Single Market"", 24 (2017) Energy Research & Social Science, pp. 51-58. , at 52; Huhta, K., A new era for capacity mechanisms-Reviewing the Commissions Clean Energy for All Europeans legislative package, 1 (2018) Oil, Gas & Energy Law; Huhta, K., Capacity Mechanisms in EU Law-A Comment on the Free Movement of Goods, , www.oxfordenergy.org/publications/, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (21.05.2018) open access at; Joskow, P., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design"", 16(3 (2008) Utilities Policy, pp. 159-170. , at 160-161 and 164-166; Roques, F., Market design for generation adequacy: Healing causes rather than symptoms (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 171-183; Hary, N., Rious, V., Saguan, M., The electricity generation adequacy problem: Assessing dynamic effects of capacity remuneration mechanisms (2016) Energy Policy, 91, pp. 113-127; Rodilla, P., Batlle, C., Security of electricity supply at the generation level: Problem analysis (2012) Energy Policy, 40, pp. 177-185. , 177-178; Huhta, K., Unleashing Consumer Potential in the Energy Transition: A Reflection of the Transforming Role of the EU Consumer OGEL Special Issue on the Energy, 2019. , Union; Huhta, K., Prioritising energy efficiency and demand side measures over capacity mechanisms under eu energy law (2017) Journal of Energy & Natural Resources Law, 35 (1), pp. 7-24; Huhta, K., Too important to be entrusted to neighbours? the dynamics of security of electricity supply and mutual trust in eu law (2018) 6 European Law Review, pp. 920-933. , Books; González-Díaz, F.E., EU policy on capacity mechanisms (2015) Capacity Mechanisms in the EU Energy Market (Oxford), pp. 3-31. , L.

These resources, whose deployment was fostered through different types of support mechanisms in the last decades, must now be integrated as much as possible in all the segments of the electricity market. Where capacity mechanisms are in place, renewable technologies should be involved in these mechanisms in the same way as any other technology. Renewables would thus not only be able to receive a capacity remuneration, but would also be subject to the commitments that a capacity contract entails. A key and challenging design feature to allow this participation is the definition of a de-rating methodology to evaluate the expected contribution to reliability from renewable technologies. This article presents a comprehensive review of international experiences on this design element, encompassing eleven power systems in the United States, Latin America, and Europe. It illustrates the great variety of regulatory approaches that can be found worldwide and presents a qualitative discussion on renewable de-rating, showing how these methodologies may have to be refined in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity credit; Capacity mechanisms; De-rating; Firm capacity; Firm energy; Reliability","Reliability; Sustainable development; Capacity credit; De ratings; Firm capacities; Firm energy; International experiences; Renewable energy technologies; Renewable technology; Support mechanism; Renewable energy resources","Hancher, L., de Hauteclocque, A., Sadowska, M., Capacity mechanisms in the EU energy market: law, policy, and economics (2015), Oxford University Press; Jenkin, T., Beiter, P., Margolis, R., Capacity payments in restructured markets under low and high penetration levels of renewable energy (2016), Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-65491; Batlle, C., Barroso, L.A., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., The changing role of the state in the expansion of electricity supply in Latin America (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (11), pp. 7152-7160; Rodilla, P., Batlle, C., Security of electricity supply at the generation level: problem analysis (2012) Energy Policy, 40, pp. 177-185; Huntington, S., Rodilla, P., Herrero, I., Batlle, C., Revisiting support policies for RES-E adulthood: towards market compatible schemes (2017) Energy Policy, 104, pp. 474-483; Blazquez, J., Fuentes-Bracamontes, R., Bollino, C.A., Nezamuddin, N., The renewable energy policy paradox (2018) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 82, pp. 1-5. , part 1; Mastropietro, P., Rodilla, P., Batlle, C., Performance incentives in capacity mechanisms: conceptual considerations and empirical evidence (2017) Econ.

However, due to the stochastic nature of renewables, the management of the rapidly increasing uncertainty and variability in power system planning and operation is of crucial significance. This paper represents a comprehensive overview of power system flexibility as an effective way to maintain the power balance at every moment. Definitions of power system flexibility from various aspects are explained to reach the reliable and economic planning and operation of the power system. The effects of the high penetration of variable energy resources on power systems and the evolution of flexibility in response to renewables are studied. A variety of resources during the flexibility evolutionary transition are introduced and discussed. As an influential flexibility solution in current power systems integrated with renewable resources, market design improvement is widely reviewed in this paper, and required modifications in market design mechanisms are investigated pertaining to various time horizons. © 2019, The Author(s).","Ancillary services; Electricity market design; Power system flexibility; Renewable energy resources","Commerce; Electric power system planning; Stochastic systems; Ancillary service; Economic advantages; Electricity market design; Evolutionary transitions; Power system flexibilities; Power system planning and operation; Renewable resource; Uncertainty and variability; Renewable energy resources","(2017) Renewables Global Futures Report, Great Debates Towards 100% Renewable Energy, , http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GFR-Full-Report-2017_webversion_3.pdf, Accessed 18 March 2019; (2013) Energy Policies of IEA Countries- Denmark 2011 Review, , https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Denmark2011_unsecured.pdf, Accessed 18 March 2019; Ohlhorst, D., Germany’s energy transition policy between national targets and decentralized responsibilities (2015) J Integr Environ Sci, 12 (4), pp. 303-322; Hirth, L., The market value of variable renewables (2013) Energy Econ, 38, pp. 218-236; Edenhofer, O., Hirth, L., Knopf, B., On the economics of renewable energy sources (2013) Energy Econ, 40, pp. 12-23; Ueckerdt, F., Hirth, L., Luderer, G., System LCOE: What are the costs of variable renewables?

However, there has been little attention so far on the interaction between a capacity market and an increasing share of renewable energy. In a first step we formalize the functioning of capacity auctions with reliability options. We improve their incentive regulation to allow effective incentives for sufficient investments. In a second step we study, with comparative statics, how an increasing share of renewable energy, varying carbon emission costs and the existing capacity mix influence the outcome of a capacity auction. For an increasing share of renewable energy, capacity auctions direct investments to more flexible power plants. This opposes the merit order effect of renewable energy which is observed at energy-only markets. A capacity market can therefore prevent missing flexibility feared at energy-only markets as a result of an increasing share of renewable energy. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Capacity markets; Electricity markets; Merit order effect; Reliability options; Renewable energy",,"Bajo-Buenestade, R., Welfare implications of capacity payments in a price-capped electricity sector: A case study of the Texas market (ERCOT) (2017) Energy Economics, 64, pp. 272-285; Bhagwat, P.C., (2016) Security of supply during the energy transition: The role of capacity mechanisms, , https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:9dddbede-5c19-40a9-9024-4dd8cbbe3062, Delft University of Technology, Accessed July 25, 2019; Bhagwat, P.C., Iychettira, K.K., Richstein, J.C., Chappin, E.J.L., De Vries, L.J., The effectiveness of capacity markets in the presence of a high (2017) Utilities Policy, 48, pp. 76-91; Bhagwat, P.C., Richstein, J.C., Chappin, E.J.L., De Vries, L.J., The effectiveness of a strategic reserve in the presence of a high portfolio share of renewable energy sources (2016) Utilities Policy, 39, pp. 13-28; Bothwell, C., Hobbs, B.F., Crediting renewables in electricity capacity markets: The effects of alternative definitions upon market efficiency (2017) The Energy Journal, 38, pp. 173-188; Caramanis, M., Investment decisions and long-term planning under electricity spot pricing (1982) IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems, 101 (12), pp. 4640-4648; Crampes, C., Creti, A., Capacity competition in electricity markets (2006) Economia delle fonti di energia e dell’ambiente, 48 (2), pp. 59-82; Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., Economics and design of capacity markets for the power sector (2012) Zeitschrift für Energiewirtschaft, 36, pp. 113-136; Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., Stoft, S., Capacity market fundamentals (2013) Economics of Energy & Environmental Policy, 2, pp. 27-46; Creti, A., Fabra, N., Suply security and short-run capacity markets for electricity (2007) Energy Economics, 29 (2), pp. 259-276; De Miera, G.S., del Rio Gonzalez, P., Vizcaino, I., Analysing the impact of renewable electricity support schemes on power prices: The case of wind electricity in Spain (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (9), pp. 3345-3359; De Vries, L.J., Generation adequacy: Helping the market do its job (2007) Utilities Policy, 15, pp. 20-35; Elberg, C., Kranz, S., (2014) Capacity mechanisms and effects on market structure.

As this transition takes place, the electricity system must maintain system adequacy and remain affordable to consumers. In liberalised electricity markets investors are seen as key actors driving this transition. Due to the intermittent character of renewable assets, such as wind or solar parks, electricity systems with large shares of renewable electricity will need to become increasingly flexible. Evaluating whether specific market designs provide the right incentives to invest in flexibility, requires the simulation of realistic investor behaviour. Agent-based modelling provides the means to explore heterogeneous, imperfectly informed and boundedly rational investor behaviour within different electricity market designs. We evaluated two market designs; “energy-only” markets and markets with a Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM). We conclude that energy-only markets, even with strong carbon pricing, do not incentivise investors to deliver a fully renewable, reliable and affordable energy system. Therefore policy makers should focus on developing CRMs which can work in combination with market incentives to reach a fully renewable, reliable and affordable electricity system in the second half of this century. © 2019 The Authors","Agent-based modelling; Electricity market design; Flexibility; Investor behaviour; Storage; Sustainability","Autonomous agents; Carbon; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric industry; Energy storage; Global warming; Power markets; Simulation platform; Sustainable development; Agent-based modelling; Electricity market design; Electricity system; Energy-only market; Flexibility; Investor behaviour; Liberalised electricity market; Renewable electricity; Investments; alternative energy; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; design; electricity supply; energy market; investment; policy making; pollution tax; sustainability","Arabali, A., Ghofrani, M., Etezadi-Amoli, M., Cost analysis of a power system using probabilistic optimal power flow with energy storage integration and wind generation (2013) Int.

We apply the model to a case study based on data from the electricity market in Texas (ERCOT) to analyze the market and investment impacts of several incentive mechanisms that support variable renewable energy (VRE) investments and carbon emission reductions. In contrast to many previous studies, the model determines least-cost VRE investments under different cost and incentive assumptions rather than analyzing scenarios where VRE expansion is pre-determined. We find that electricity prices can vary significantly under different incentive mechanisms, even when comparable generation portfolios result. Therefore, the preferred incentive mechanism depends on stakeholder objectives as well as the prevailing electricity market framework. Our results indicate that a carbon tax is more system cost-efficient for reducing emissions, while production and investment tax credits are more system cost-efficient for increasing VRE investments. Similarly, incentive mechanisms that reduce electricity prices may increase the need for separate revenue sufficiency mechanisms (e.g. a capacity market) more than a policy that increases electricity prices. Moreover, the impacts on consumer payments are not always aligned with changes in system costs. Overall, the analysis illustrates the importance of considering electricity market impacts in assessing the economic efficiency of VRE and carbon incentive mechanisms. © 2019","Carbon policy; Electricity markets; Expansion planning; Production cost modeling; Renewable energy policy; Variable renewable energy","Carbon; Commerce; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric industry; Emission control; Energy policy; Expansion; Power markets; Taxation; Carbon policy; Expansion planning; Production cost model; Renewable energy policy; Variable renewable energies; Investments; alternative energy; commodity price; electricity generation; emission control; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; environmental economics; pollution tax","Abolhosseini, S., Heshmati, A., The main support mechanisms to finance renewable energy development (2014) Renew.

As these are exposed to intermittency, seasonality, and global-climate-variation, policy-makers’ concerns are now shifting towards security of supply. In fact, the industry confronts three conflicting goals: security of supply, competitive prices to customers, and environmental protection. In this context, and given the multiple uncertainties of technology transformation, this paper uses modelling-based scenario analysis to investigate different extreme and plausible futures. Simulation is used to analyse policies aimed at increasing the penetration of renewables and to explore how these energy sources may affect system reliability. This paper explores the effect of incorporating renewables in Colombia, where a large hydroelectric component has led to insufficient electricity being available during droughts and to high electricity price volatility. Though not intuitive at first glance, this paper shows that renewables may contribute to: i) increased security of supply through complementarity, e.g., it does not rain when the sun shines; ii) reduced price volatility in the medium-term, and iii) increased industry sustainability. © 2019","Electricity markets; Renewables; Security of supply; System dynamics","Electric power systems; Power markets; Sustainable development; System theory; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Competitive prices; Electricity industry; Electricity price volatilities; Renewable energy source; Renewables; Security of supply; System Dynamics; System reliability; Energy security; alternative energy; drought; electricity supply; energy market; hydroelectric power; price dynamics; security; sustainability; technological development; Colombia","Akif, M., Aslan, A., Renewable and non-renewable energy consumption and economic growth in emerging economies: evidence from bootstrap panel causality (2017) Renew.

We show that capacity payments increase capacity and expected consumer surplus, with little or no effect on expected social welfare (expected consumer surplus plus expected profits minus the cost of using capacity payments minus expected outage costs). In addition, we demonstrate that capacity payments can substantially reduce or, sometimes, fully eliminate electricity outage costs due to price capping or unexpected failure of some generation capacity. Thus, regulators should consider using this form of capacity payments since, in addition to their favorable effect on consumers and on social welfare, they mitigate the ‘missing money’ problem and increase system reliability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity payments; Electricity markets; Endogenous capacity; Missing money; Outage costs","Commerce; Outages; Power markets; Reliability; Capacity payments; Competitive electricity markets; Endogenous capacities; Generation capacity; Missing money; Outage cost; System reliability; Unexpected Failures; Costs; competitiveness; consumption behavior; cost analysis; electricity supply; price dynamics; profitability; welfare impact","Bajo-Buenestado, R., Welfare implications of capacity payments in a price-capped electricity sector: a case study of the Texas market (ERCOT) (2017) Energy Econ., 64, pp. 272-285; Bernstein, R., Madlener, R., Short- and long-run electricity demand elasticities at the subsectoral level: a cointegration analysis for German manufacturing industries (2015) Energy Econ., 48, pp. 178-187; Bhagwat, P.C., Iychettira, K.K., Richstein, J.C., Chappin, E.J.L., De Vries, L.J., The effectiveness of capacity markets in the presence of a high portfolio share of renewable energy sources (2017) Util.

These changes are creating challenges for wholesale markets in two dimensions. Short-term energy and ancillary services markets, built upon mid-twentieth century models of optimal pricing and investment, which now work reasonably well, must accommodate the supply variability and energy market price impacts associated with intermittent generation at scale. These developments raise more profound questions about whether the current market designs can be adapted to provide good long-term price signals to support investment in an efficient portfolio of generating capacity and storage consistent with public policy goals. The recent experience of the California ISO (CAISO) is used to illustrate the impact of intermittent generation on supply patterns, supply variability, and market-based energy prices. Reforms in capacity markets and scarcity pricing mechanisms are needed if policy-makers seek to adapt the traditional wholesale market designs to accommodate intermittent generation at scale. However, if the rapid growth of integrated resource planning, subsidies for some technologies but not others, mandated long term contracts, and other expansions of state regulation continue, more fundamental changes are likely to be required in the institutions that determine generator and storage entry and exit decisions. © The Author(s) 2019.

Through the analysis, we found that OCGT was weak in the Korean electricity market due to 3 factors: high load factor, high price of liquefied natural gas, and existing inefficient power plants. Using the conformity theory of the optimum in resource planning and the equilibrium in market dynamics, we verified the reasons by implementing resource planning using the Wien Automatic System Planning (WASP)-Ⅳ package with actual market data for the 16 years from 2001 to 2016. In addition, considering the new energy policy of Korea, shifting main sources of electricity generation from nuclear and coal to clean renewable energies and natural gas, we analyzed the competitiveness of OCGT in the future Korean electricity market. We identified the factors unfavorable for OCGT in the current market and suggested what should be changed to cope with high renewable energy penetration. © 2019","Korean electricity market; Open-cycle gas turbine; Renewable energy; System flexibility","Competition; Electric industry; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Gases; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Power markets; Resource allocation; Automatic systems; Electricity generation; Market dynamics; Open cycle gas turbines; Renewable energies; Renewable energy penetrations; Resource planning; System flexibility; Commerce; alternative energy; competitiveness; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; future prospect; power plant; turbine; South Korea","Ahn, J., Woo, J.R., Lee, J., Optimal allocation of energy sources for sustainable development in South Korea: focus on the electric power generation industry (2015) Energy Policy, 78, pp. 78-90; Brattle, Cost of New Entry Estimate for Combustion Turbine and Combined Cycle Plants in PJM (2014), The Brattle Group Boston, U.S; Breeze, P., The Cost of Power Generation; the Current and Future Competitiveness of Renewable and Traditional Technologies (2010), Business Insights UK; Center for Energy, Environmental, and Economic System Analysis (CEEESA, CEEESA Power Systems Analysis Tools (2018), https://ceeesa.es.anl.gov/projects/PowerAnalysisTools.html, Available online: (Accessed 19 September 2018); Cramton, P., Electricity market design (2017) Oxf.

The run-up in the capital stock was driven by forecast demand growth and a tightening of reliability standards. But demand contracted from 2010 to 2015. With a rising RAB, contracting demand and a regulated revenue constraint, an adverse cycle of falling demand and sharply rising tariffs appeared to be emerging. Some networks were characterised by significant investment mistakes in retrospect, and perhaps unsurprisingly, various consumer groups and regulatory bodies argued assets should be stranded or written-off with network tariffs reduced. From 2015 to 2018, energy demand increased once again. In this article we present a method for dealing with stranded assets under uncertainty; rather than permanently stranding assets that fail a used and useful test, we reorganise the financial and economic affairs of a template network utility and “Park” excess capacity, issue credit-wrapped bonds to temporarily finance the stranded capital stock, then re-test the Parked Assets at the end of each five-year regulatory determination. Parked Assets can then be “Un-Parked” and returned-to-service in line with connections growth, load growth, or both. This produces an immediate reduction in network tariffs under our generalised assumptions, but scarce government balance sheet capacity is necessarily utilised and recovery risk is transferred from shareholders to taxpayers. Accordingly, a Park and Loan policy is not a costless exercise. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Electricity utilities; Falling demand; Stranded assets","Economics; Investments; Risk perception; Taxation; Economic affairs; Electricity networks; Falling demand; National electricity markets; Regulatory bodies; Regulatory determination; Reliability standard; Stranded assets; Electric network parameters; capital; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy policy; investment; tariff structure; Australia","ACCC: Australian Competition & Consumer Commission, Restoring electricity affordability and Australia's competitive advantage (2018) Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry – Final Report, , Commonwealth of Australia Canberra; Averch, H., Johnson, L., Behaviour of the firm under regulatory constraint (1962) Am.

On the other hand, the political, social, and economic consequences of shortage of power generation are inevitable under any condition. Thus, several incentives have been introduced to support investment in GC. Currently, the capacity payment mechanism is used for this purpose in the Iranian power market. In addition, the mechanism, along with its benefits, is suffering from some inadequacies and inefficiencies. The present study aimed to introduce Iranian power market and the specifications of the capacity mechanism used in this market. Accordingly, a new incentive called 'Capacity Certificate' which has been adopted for Iranian power market is modelled and analysed, along with explaining its characteristics. Regarding the advantage of system dynamics, the effect of this mechanism on the long-term performance of the power market was evaluated from the perspective of the GC expansion and was compared with the capacity payment mechanism. The results revealed that using the capacity certificate mechanism in Iranian power market can be considered as a step forward toward a better system reserve and lower cost. © 2019 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.","investment; power markets","Commerce; Expansion; Power markets; Capacity payment mechanism; Economic consequences; Generation capacity; Long term performance; Optimal investments; Practical experience; System Dynamics; Theoretical study; Investments","Briggs, R.J., Kleit, A., Resource adequacy reliability and the impacts of capacity subsidies in competitive electricity markets (2013) Energy Econ., 40, pp. 297-305; Sener, A.C., A hybrid resource adequacy compensation mechanism (2013) Electr.

As a consequence, existing market designs are adapted, and new capacity remuneration mechanisms are introduced. However, these mechanisms entail new challenges, and it is disputed whether they are indeed needed. In this article, an overview of the current debate on the necessity of capacity remuneration mechanisms is provided. Furthermore, initial experiences of real-world implementations are discussed, and common findings in the literature, categorized by their economic implications, are derived. Finally, shortcomings in existing research and open questions that need to be addressed in future works are pointed out. © 2019 The Authors","Capacity markets; Capacity remuneration mechanisms; Electricity market; Generation adequacy; Market design","Electric industry; Power markets; Capacity markets; Economic implications; Electricity market design; Electricity supply; Generation adequacy; Market design; Real-world implementation; Renewable energies; Commerce; design; electricity supply; future prospect; research; survey; theoretical study","Aalami, H.A., Moghaddam, M.P., Yousefi, G.R., Demand response modeling considering interruptible/curtailable loads and capacity market programs (2010) Appl.

The first design corresponds to a Deterministic Market Clearing (DMC) similar to the mechanism currently used in organized wholesale electricity markets in the United States. The other three designs account for the day-ahead (DA) wind power production uncertainty into the DA market mechanisms either implicitly or explicitly. An Augmented Deterministic Market Clearing (ADMC) design introduces DA ramp-capability products. These products ensure adequate and ramp-feasible electricity generation capacity commitments in the DA stage to cope with the real-time realization of wind power generation. A Hybrid Deterministic Market clearing (HDMC) design augments ADMC by explicitly integrating a characterization of wind power production uncertainty into the residual unit commitment (RUC) process, which is run after the DA market is closed, using stochastic programming. The last design, referred to as stochastic market clearing (SMC), uses stochastic optimization to explicitly account for wind power production uncertainty in the DA market clearing mechanisms (i.e. DA unit commitment and economic dispatch). The four market clearing designs are assessed by simulating the electricity market operations of a test system and comparing their results in terms of operating costs, prices, costs and revenues of different types of producers, consumer's payments, integration of wind power, and air emissions. The test system has 12% of the capacity of PJM's fossil-fired power generation fleet, and uses data on coincident demand and wind power production from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) system during years 2010–2014. The simulations are performed hourly for a whole year. Results show that SMC is superior as its costs reductions are more than two times the improvements attained by ADMC and HDMC. Also, SMC results in electricity prices that are better aligned with operation costs, cuts the spread between the day-ahead and real-time prices by &gt;40%, reduces out-of-market short-term revenue sufficiency payments by 58%, reduces CO 2 emissions by 3.52%, and decreases power plants’ cycling. HDMC is a distant second-best market design. Relative to DMC, it achieves a reduction in total costs that is less than half the reduction achieved by SMC, a reduction in out-of-market payments that is 80% of the reduction attained by SMC, and an increase in wind power integration that is &lt;10% the improvement obtained under SMC. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Hidden uncertainty costs; Market clearing design; Price formation; Two-settlement markets; Wind energy","Commerce; Cost reduction; Electric industry; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Operating costs; Product design; Scheduling; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Bonneville power administrations; Electricity generation capacity; Electricity market operations; Environmental implications; Market clearing; Market clearing mechanisms; Price formation; Wholesale electricity markets; Power markets; cost analysis; design; electricity supply; energy market; power generation; price determination; uncertainty analysis; wind power; United States","Abbaspourtorbati, F., Conejo, A., Wang, J., Cherkaoui, R., Three- or two-stage stochastic market-clearing algorithm?

Lib. Gral. San Martín 1109(O), San Juan, J5400ARL, Argentina","In liberalized electricity markets, the investment postponement option is deemed decisive for understanding the addition of new generating capacity. Basically, it refers to the possibility for investors to postpone projects for a period while waiting for the arrival of new and better information about the market evolution. When such development involves major uncertainties, the generation business becomes riskier, and the investors' “wait-and-see” behavior might limit the timely addition of new power plants. In that sense, the literature provides solid empirical evidence about the occurrence of construction cycles in the deregulated electricity industry. However, the strategic flexibility inherent to the option to defer new power plants has not yet been rigorously incorporated to investment signals in existing market models. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel methodology to assess the long-term development of liberalized power markets based on a more realistic approach for valuing generation investments. The work is based on a stochastic dynamic market model, built upon System Dynamics simulation approach. The decision-making framework considers that the addition of new capacity is driven by the economic value of the strategic flexibility associated with deferring investments under uncertainties. Thus, the value of the postponement option is quantified in monetary terms through Real Options Analysis. Simulations confirm the cyclical behavior of the energy-only market in the long run, as suggested by the empirical evidence found in the literature. In addition, sensitivity analysis regarding some relevant exogenous variables depicts an even more fluctuating evolution of the capacity due to the combination of strong demand growth rates with large volatilities. Finally, the model validity is assessed through a formal procedure according to the scope of System Dynamics modeling approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Power generation; Power market; Real options; Stochastic simulation; Strategic flexibility; System dynamics","Commerce; Decision making; Electric industry; Power generation; Power markets; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; System theory; Value engineering; Decision-making frameworks; Deregulated electricity industry; Liberalized electricity market; Real Options; Stochastic simulations; Strategic flexibility; System Dynamics; System dynamics simulation; Investments; electricity generation; electricity supply; investment; market development; numerical model; stochasticity","Abadie, L.M., Chamorro, J.M., Valuing flexibility: the case of an integrated gasification combined cycle power plant (2008) Energy Econ., 30 (4), pp. 1850-1881; Abani, A.O., Hary, N., Saguan, M., Rious, V., Risk aversion and generation adequacy in liberalized electricity markets: benefits of capacity markets (2016) 2016 IEEE International Conference on the European Energy Market, pp. 1-5. , (Porto, PT); Ahmad, S., Tahar, R.M., Muhammad-Sukki, F., Munir, A.B., Rahim, R.A., Application of system dynamics approach in electricity sector modelling: a review (2016) Renew.

This is due to some inherent characteristics of power systems, such as high investment costs, and various risks in profit and return of capital. On the other hand, the political, social, and economic consequences of shortage of power generation are intolerable in any conditions. As a result, several incentives such as capacity payment, capacity auction, capacity obligation, and strategic reserve have been introduced to support investment in generation capacity. But all these incentives suffer from a number of inadequacies and inefficiencies. In this paper, first a new incentive called Capacity Certificate is proposed and its characteristics are explained. Then, taking the advantage of System Dynamics, the impact of this mechanism on long-term performance of power market is studied from the generation capacity expansion perspective, and is compared with energy-only and capacity payment mechanisms. Indicators such as system reserve and the overall customer payments reveal the benefits of the proposed mechanism. In addition, this mechanism effectively motivates the customers to optimize their energy consumption, while none of the other incentives has such a capability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity certificate; Capacity mechanism; Generation capacity expansion; System dynamics","Commerce; Energy utilization; Expansion; Power markets; System theory; Capacity certificate; Capacity payment mechanism; Economic consequences; Generation capacity; Inherent characteristics; Long term performance; Practical experience; System Dynamics; Investments; capital; certification; electricity; energy market; incentive; performance assessment; power generation","Rodilla, P., Batlle, C., Security of electricity supply at the generation level: problem analysis (2012) Energy Pol, 40, pp. 177-185; Conejo, A.J., Baringo, L., Kazempour, S.J., Siddiqui, A.S., Investment in electricity generation and transmission (2016), springer; Harris, C., Modeling capacity using derivatives (2015) Peak load and capacity pricing, pp. 141-181. , Springer; Neuhoff, K., De Vries, L., Insufficient incentives for investment in electricity generations (2004) Util Pol, 12 (4), pp. 253-267; Hogan, W.W., On an ‘Energy only’ electricity market design for resource adequacy (2005), Calif.

Therefore, renewable energies and especially wind units have become a central point of attention. The stochastic nature of wind power production is modeled by means of a scenario-based method to show the possible events in the real time. Based on the Monte-Carlo simulation method and employing constructed Rayleigh probability distribution function (PDF), several scenarios that demonstrate the behavior of wind farms in real time are generated. To this end, a uniform random variable is generated and assigned to the mentioned PDF. Afterwards, a wind speed with a probability is achieved followed by the amount of wind power generation. Also, with a scenario reduction method (forward method), the desired number of scenarios can be obtained. To cope with the uncertainties of wind power generation, resulting from the intermittent nature of this kind of energy, this paper proposes a demand response (DR)-based operation approach. In other words, unlike the previous models in the literature that considered a supplementary role for the DR, this paper introduces the main role for the DR in the operation of future electricity markets. This approach focuses on a comprehensive modeling of the DR programs (DRPs) for the operational scheduling of electricity markets, considering the uncertainties of the generation of wind turbines, aiming at increasing the network security and decreasing the operation cost. The incorporation of market-based DRPs, such as demand bidding and ancillary service DR, is also considered. Two novel quantitative indices are introduced to analyze the success of DRPs regarding efficiency and wind integration. Numerical results obtained on two IEEE test systems indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2018 IEEE.","Demand response; DR-based operation model; electricity market; quantitative index; renewable energy; stochastic programming","Climate change; Commerce; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Interactive computer systems; Mathematical models; Network security; Power markets; Real time systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; Wind turbines; Demand response; Indexes; Load modeling; Operation model; Quantitative indices; Renewable energies; Electric load management","Asensio, M., Contreras, J., Risk-constrained optimal bidding strategy for pairing of wind and demand response resources (2017) IEEE Trans.

We model DR in an Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) framework with high levels of wind penetration. Investment, exit and operational decisions are optimized simultaneously. We examine the potential for DR to participate in both energy and reserve markets. DR participation in the energy market reduces costs and prices and gives rise to lower equilibrium levels of investment in conventional generation. DR and wind generation are strongly complementary, due to the ability of DR to mitigate against the variability of wind generation, with the highest reduction of consumer costs seen at high levels of wind penetration. The total impact of DR is highly dependent on specific system characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Load-shifting; Markets; Reserve",,"Strbac, G., Demand side management: benefits and challenges (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (12), pp. 4419-4426; Zhou, Y., Mancarella, P., Mutale, J., Modelling and assessment of the contribution of demand response and electrical energy storage to adequacy of supply (2015) Sustainable Energy Grids Netw., 3, pp. 12-23; Ma, O., Alkadi, N., Cappers, P., Denholm, P., Dudley, J., Goli, S., Hummon, M., O'Malley, M., Demand response for ancillary services (2013) IEEE Trans.

Iran has the second largest reservoirs of natural gas in the world and exports it to different countries. On the other hand, in the restructured power system, the role of natural gas is growing in the electricity generation due to its lower pollution. This paper analyzes different scenarios for exporting the natural gas including direct transfer at forward and hub prices, exporting at citygate price, conversion into electricity for exporting at forward price, and transferring via the power market. In this regard, system dynamics is applied for long-term analysis of the considered scenarios. The natural gas price is modeled by Markov chain Monte Carlo for a long-term period, and the models are analyzed using the data published by the energy information administration. The results show that exporting the natural gas or the electricity in suitable forward price are the most profitable scenarios. While exporting the natural gas at the demand price is profitable, transferring the electricity via the power market cannot meet the economic goals, even by expanding the renewable resources. © 2018 IEEE","Electricity; Export; Natural gas; Power market; Price; System dynamics","Analytical models; Biological systems; Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Gases; Investments; Markov processes; Natural gas deposits; Power markets; Profitability; System theory; Biological system modeling; Electricity generation; Energy Information Administration; export; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; price; Restructured power systems; System Dynamics; Natural gas","Cui, A.S., Zhao, M., Ravichandran, T., Market uncertainty and dynamic new product launch strategies: A system dynamics model (2011) IEEE Trans.

The proposed mechanism uses a scheme which delivers the schedule of power supplied to or drawn from the grid by treating the mobility attributes dependent electrical parameters. Two operational places, the workplace, and the home were identified as per driving pattern of customers for the provision of regulation ancillary service. An illustrative model considering a fleet of representative battery electric vehicle (BEV) is presented based on the mechanism, to obtain the minute-wise storage capacity that can be contracted in the market to provide frequency regulation to the grid. Results demonstrate that two major mobility traits namely, driven distance and arrival pattern, as well as the charging and discharging power standards directly influences the regulation schedule. Further, it has been realized that even though the charging cost is associated with energy consumption, the regulation provision will yield a notable revenue stream on a long-term capacity commitment basis. This supplements the concept of EVs participation in power markets by virtue of their high ramp up ramp down speed capabilities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ancillary services; Charging-discharging power; Electric vehicle; Grid-to-vehicle (G2V); Power scheduling; Regulation capacity; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Vehicle-to-grid; Ancillary service; Charging-discharging power; Grid to vehicle (G2V); Power Scheduling; Regulation capacity; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Electric power transmission networks","Abousleiman, R., Scholer, R., Smart charging: System design and implementation for interaction between plug-in electric vehicles and the power grid (2015) IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification, 1 (1), pp. 18-25; Amini, M.H., Kargarian, A., Karabasoglu, O., Arima-based decoupled time series forecasting of electric vehicle charging demand for stochastic power system operation (2016) Electric Power Systems Research, 140, pp. 378-390; Amini, M.H., Moghaddam, M.P., Karabasoglu, O., Simultaneous allocation of electric vehicles’ parking lots and distributed renewable resources in smart power distribution networks (2017) Sustainable Cities and Society, 28, pp. 332-342; Bai, X., Qiao, W., Wei, H., Huang, F., Chen, Y., Bidirectional coordinating dispatch of large-scale V2G in a future smart grid using complementarity optimization (2015) International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, 68, pp. 269-277; Berman, B., The ultimate guide to electric car charging networks (2018), https://www.plugincars.com/ultimate-guide-electric-car-charging-networks-126530.html, Plugincars Available at: [Online]; Bessa, R.J., Matos, M.A., Economic and technical management of an aggregation agent for electric vehicles: A literature survey (2012) European Transactions on Electrical Power, 22 (3), pp. 334-350; Božič, D., Pantoš, M., Impact of electric-drive vehicles on power system reliability (2015) Energy, 83, pp. 511-520; Chen, M., Rincon-Mora, G.A., Accurate, compact, and power-efficient Li-ion battery charger circuit (2006) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems – II: Express Briefs, 53 (11), pp. 1180-1184; Darabi, Z., Ferdowsi, M., Aggregated impact of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles on electricity demand profile (2011) IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 2 (4), pp. 501-508; Duvall, M., Alexander, M., Maitra, A., Saucedo, D., Jungers, B., Halliwell, J., Transportation electrification: A technology overview, Tech.

However, due to the intermittent nature of the renewables, the conventional generations are required to maintain flexibility in times of scarcity. In order to resolve this reliability problem, the independent system operator (ISO) plans in advance to facilitate building new capacity in long-term through capacity markets. The flexible conventional generations lack incentives to maintain operation and build new generations due to low revenue from the energy and ancillary services markets. This paper proposes an idea to incorporate renewable generations in the capacity markets within the virtual power plant model as capacity market units. The proposed idea increases the flexibility of renewable generation output with and/or without energy storage systems. Therefore, it will be particularly beneficial for ISO to increase the renewable capacity in the generation mix. © 2018 IEEE.","Capacity markets; Cost of new entry; Demand response; Energy storage system; Renewables; Virtual power plant","Electric energy storage; Electric utilities; Capacity markets; Demand response; Energy storage systems; Renewables; Virtual power plants; Commerce","2030 Energy Strategy, , https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-strategy-and-energyunion/2030-energy-strategy, European Commission; Griffes, P.H., Renewable generation and capacity markets (2014) IAEE Energy Forum Cleveland; Höschle, H., De Jonghe, C., Six, D., Belmans, R., Capacity remuneration mechanisms and the transition to low-carbon power systems (2015) 2015 12th ICEEM, Lisbon, pp. 1-5; Creti, A., Fabra, N., (2003) Capacity Markets for Electricity; Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., Economics and design of capacity markets for the power sector (2012) Zeitschrift Fur Energiewirtschaft, 36 (2), pp. 113-134; (2015), Appendix 5: Electricity Market Reform (EMR)"" 2010 to 2015 government policy: UK energy security; Pudjianto, D., Ramsay, C., Strbac, G., Virtual power plant and system integration of distributed energy resources (2007) IET Renewable Power Generation, 1 (1), pp. 10-16. , March; Zhao, Q., Shen, Y., Li, M., Control and bidding strategy for virtual power plants with renewable generation and inelastic demand in electricity markets (2016) IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 7 (2), pp. 562-575. , April; Plancke, G., De Vos, K., Belmans, R., Delnooz, A., Virtual power plants: Definition, applications and barriers to the implementation in the distribution system (2015) 2015 12th ICEEM, pp. 1-5. , Lisbon; Zamani, A.G., Zakariazadeh, A., Jadid, S., Kazemi, A., Operational scheduling of virtual power plants in the presence of energy storages and demand response programs for participating in the energy market (2015) 2015 20th Conference on EPDC, pp. 218-222. , Zahedan; Pudjianto, D., Strbac, G., Boyer, D., Virtual power plant: Managing synergies and conflicts between transmission system operator and distribution system operator control objectives (2017) CIRED-Open Access Proceedings Journal, 2017 (1), pp. 2049-2052. , 10; Bagchi, A., Goel, L., Wang, P., Studying the impacts of incorporating energy storage devices into an aggregated probabilistic model of a virtual power plant (2016) 2016 International Conference on PMAPS, pp. 1-6. , Beijing; (2015) Capacity Mechanism Working Group, , Assessing generation adequacy and the necessity of capacity mechanisms22 Jan; Oren, S.S., (2000) Capacity Payments and Supply Adequacy in Competitive Electricity Markets, , Sepope, May; Finon, D., Pignon, V., Electricity and long-term capacity adequacy: The quest for regulatory mechanism compatible with electricity market (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 143-158; (2011) NERC, , Methods to Model and Calculate Capacity Contributions of Variable Generation for Resource Adequacy Planning; (2013) Department of Energy and Climate Change, , Annex C: Reliability Standard Methodology; All-island generation capacity statement 2017-2026' (2017) EirGrid and System Operator of Northern Ireland (SONI), , EirGrid, S.

To guarantee capacity adequacy, policy-makers may provide support for generation through a capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM) and/or encourage demand response (DR). Such mechanisms are formalised within a common simple analytical framework, clarifying how these mechanisms relate to each other. We then divide them into two categories, depending on whether their implementation requires transactions to be made based explicitly on spot prices higher than the price cap. While mechanisms that keep implicit these high marginal costs are likely to be preferred from a political perspective, they also appear to be less efficient. If they are to be implemented nonetheless, we suggest that the price cap should be set higher than the marginal cost of the most expensive plant, and highlight that challenges for demand-response integration in CRMs remain. © 2019 by the IAEE.","Capacity adequacy; Capacity remuneration mechanisms; Demand response; Electricity market design; Liberalised electricity markets",,"Adib, P., Schubert, E., Oren, S., (2008) Chapter 9: Resource Adequacy: Alternate Perspectives and Divergent Paths; Astier, N., Léautier, T., Demand response: Smart market designs for smart consumers (2018) Mimeo; Batlle, C., Rodilla, P., A critical assessment of the different approaches aimed to secure electricity generation supply (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (11), pp. 7169-7179; Chao, H.-P., Price-responsive demand management for a smart grid world (2010) The Electricity Journal, 23 (1), pp. 7-20; Chao, H.-P., Competitive electricity markets with consumer subscription service in a smart grid (2012) Journal of Regulatory Economics, 41 (1), pp. 155-180; Chao, H.-P., Oren, S., Smith, S., Wilson, R., Priority service: Market structure and competition (1988) The Energy Journal; Chao, H.-P., Wilson, R., Resource Adequacy and Market Power Mitigation Via Option Contracts; Chao, H.-P., Wilson, R., Priority service : Pricing, investment, and market organization (1987) American Economic Review, 77 (5), pp. 899-916; Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., Stoft, S., Capacity market fundamentals (2013) Economics of Energy & Environmental Policy, 2 (2), pp. 27-46; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., (2006) The Convergence of Market Designs for Adequate Generating Capacity with Special Attention to the Caiso's Resource Adequacy Problem, , Berkeley, California, White Paper for the Electricity Oversight Board; De Maere D'Aertrycke, G., Ehrenmann, A., Smeers, Y., Investment with incomplete markets for risk: The need for long-term (2017) Energy Policy, 105, pp. 571-583. , January; De Vries, L.J., Hakvoort, R.A., (2004) The Question of Generation Adequacy in Liberalised Electricity Markets, , Working Papers, Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, 2004.120; De Vries, L.J., Generation adequacy: Helping the market do its job (2007) Utilities Policy, 15 (1), pp. 20-35; (2014) Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection and Energy 2014-2020, , European Commission; (2016) Interim Report of the Sector Inquiry on Capacity Mechanisms, , European Commission, Technical report; Gillan, J., (2018) Dynamic Pricing, Attention, and Automation: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Electricity Consumption, , Technical report, Working paper; Harding, M., Sexton, S., Household response to time-varying electricity prices (2017) Annual Review of Resource Economics, 9, pp. 337-359; Hartman, R.S., Doane, M.J., Woo, C., Consumer rationality and the status quo (1991) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106 (1), pp. 141-162; Hary, N., Rious, V., Saguan, M., The electricity generation adequacy problem: Assessing dynamic effects of capacity remuneration mechanisms (2016) Energy Policy, 91, pp. 113-127; Hogan, W.W., (2010) Demand Response Pricing in Organized Wholesale Markets; Joskow, P., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 159-170; Joskow, P., Symposium on 'capacity markets' (2013) Economics of Energy and Environmental Policy, 2 (2); Lambin, X., Léautier, T., Cross-border effects of capacity remuneration schemes in interconnected markets: Who is free-riding?

Since the implementation of independent national capacity markets is not in line with the target of a pan-European internal electricity market we investigate the impacts of uncoordinated capacity markets compared with coordinated capacity markets. A probabilistic approach for the determination of capacity requirements is proposed and a European electricity market model (E2M2s) is applied for evaluation. The model simultaneously optimizes investments and dispatch of power plants. Besides the impact on generation investments, market prices and system costs we analyze effects on production and security of supply. While coordinated capacity markets reveal high potentials for cross-border synergies and cost savings, uncoordinated and unilateral implementations can lead to inefficiencies, in particular free riding effects and endanger security of supply due to adverse allocation of generation capacity. © 2019 by the IAEE.

However, regulation does not always send the right signals to generate the required (and timely) investments. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effect of alternative regulations on investment on transmission capacity. In this paper, considering regulated remuneration, we perform this evaluation with a behavioral simulation model of the transmission capacity expansion, in which capacity is endogenously determined by the demand/supply relation. Two planning approaches were considered: centralized planning where the investments are fully coordinated by a central organism, and decentralized planning where the capacity expansions are driven by the investors’ rationality on the power market evolution. The model is applied to the Colombian case. The decentralized approach has lower costs (usage charges) than centralized expansion, but lower transmission capacity margins. As low transmission capacity margins create supply risks in high demand periods, regulators can increase coordination in decentralized planning by directly promoting investments that increase security of supply. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity expansion; Electricity markets; Power transmission planning; System dynamics","Biology; Commerce; Electric power transmission; Expansion; Investments; Planning; Power markets; Power transmission; Behavioral simulation; Capacity expansion; Decentralized approach; Decentralized planning; Power transmission capacity; Power transmission planning; System Dynamics; Transmission capacities; Electric power system planning","Kishore, T.S., Singal, S.K., Optimal economic planning of power transmission lines: a review (2014) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 39, pp. 949-974; Ahmed, T., Mekhilef, S., Shah, R., Mithulananthan, N., Seyedmahmoudian, M., Horan, B., ASEAN power grid: a secure transmission infrastructure for clean and sustainable energy for South-East Asia (2017) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 67, pp. 1420-1435; Pérez Odeh, R., Watts, D., Flores, Y., Planning in a changing environment: applications of portfolio optimisation to deal with risk in the electricity sector (2018) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 82, pp. 3808-3823; Lumbreras, S., Ramos, A., The new challenges to transmission expansion planning.

It first presents the Italian context, explaining how the discussion started more than a decade ago and how it evolved since then. Then, it provides an in-depth description and critical analysis of the mechanism under proposal, based on its main design elements, keeping always as a reference the guidelines issued by the European Commission on CRMs. Many valuable lessons can be extracted from the Italian experience to shed light on other similar processes currently under development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity remuneration mechanisms; Design elements; Flexibility; Italy; Reliability options; System adequacy","Energy policy; Critical analysis; Critical review; Design elements; European Commission; Flexibility; Italy; Over capacity; System adequacy; Design; critical analysis; design; electricity supply; energy policy; policy implementation; Italy","AEEG, (2011), 2011, Autorità per l'energia elettrica e il gas Criteri e condizioni per la disciplina del sistema di remunerazione della disponibilità di capacità produttiva di energia elettrica, ai sensi dell'articolo 2 del decreto legislativo 19 dicembre 2003, n. 379.

We study the long–term effects of two common network congestion management regimes on investment in production and transmission facilities. We compare locational marginal pricing, where transmission constraints are directly taken into account by spot–market prices, with a regime of uniform prices, where transmission constraints are taken into account by subsequent congestion measures. We propose an analytically tractable framework to show that, as compared to locational marginal pricing, uniform pricing can lead to overinvestment in transmission facilities and total production capacities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Generation investment; Redispatch; Transmission investment","electricity supply; investment incentive; networking; pricing policy","Acer, Opinion on the Compliance of National No. 09/2015 (2015), Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators; Bajo-Buenestado, R., Welfare implications of capacity payments in a price-capped electricity sector: a case study of the Texas market (ERCOT) (2017) Energy Econ., 64, pp. 272-285; Bjørndal, E., Bjørndal, M., Rud, L., Congestion management by dispatch or re-dispatch: flexibility costs and market power effects (2013) European Energy Market (EEM), 2013 10th International Conference on the, pp. 1–8.

A robust framework for modeling communications between market participants is proposed. Multi-agent simulation provides a capability for simulating interaction and communication among the market participants. The developed approach considers counteraction and influences of decisions made by generation companies (GenCos) in the level of investments, so GenCos investments in dynamic environment will be modeled. Reinforcement learning has been applied in order to smart out the agents and modeling the intellectual decision makers. In addition, fuel cost and load growth uncertainties have been considered. In this model, GenCos decisions are converge to the Nash equilibrium point. The environment of investment for each GenCo is defined in a way that it observes Markov property. So, the problem can be considered as an episodic decision making over years of planning. Using this approach, in a case study three incentive capacity mechanisms have been appraised. © 2018 IEEE.","capacity mechanisms; generation expansion mechanisms; multiagent systems; reinforcement learning","Commerce; Decision making; Dynamics; Electric power transmission networks; Expansion; Machine learning; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Smart power grids; Dynamic environments; Generation companies; Generation expansion; Generation expansion planning; Investment dynamics; Market participants; Multi agent simulation; Nash equilibrium point; Investments","(2003) Power Generation Investment in Electricity Market, in Energy Market Reform; Pereira, S., Ferreira, P., Vaz, A., Generation expansion planning with high share of renewables of variable output (2017) Applied Energy Journal, 190, pp. 1275-1288; Liasi, S.G., Bathaee, S.M.T., Optimizing microgrid using demand response and electric vehicles connection to microgrid (2017) Smart Grid Conference, pp. 1-7; Moreira, A., Pozo, D., Street, A., Sauma, E., Reliable renewable generation and transmission expansion planning: Co-optimizing system's resources for meeting renewable targets (2017) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 32 (4), pp. 3246-3257; Tohidi, Y., Olmos, L., Rivier, M., Hesamzadeh, M., Coordination of generation and transmission development through generation transmission charges - A game theoretical approach (2017) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 32 (2), pp. 1103-1114; Chuang, A.S., Wu, F., Varaiya, P., A game-theoretic model for generation expansion planning: Problem formulation and numerical comparisons (2001) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 16 (4), pp. 885-891; Ventosa, M., Denis, R., Redondo, C., Expansion planning in electricity market.

Optimization is realized by a criteria of maximum of social welfare. Social welfare includes profits of generating companies according penalties of unreliable electricity supply, consumer surplus, costs for development and servicing of electricity grids. Adequacy analysis of variants of development of electric power system is based on multiple estimation of electricity shortage in a random hour of system work. We analyze system work in each of a random hour in two stages. For the first stage we define equilibrium electricity demand in each system node and equilibrium price of electricity according to Cournot model. For the next stage failures of power generating equipment and transmission lines are simulated. We also estimate of electricity shortage in a current hour on the second stage. Reliability indexes and profits of generating companies are formed after a whole cycle of computations. Values of a profit are depended on reliability of electricity supply.

Market designs have varied with some countries adopting ‘energy-only’ markets and others utilising capacity remuneration mechanisms. With increasing deployment of cost competitive renewable energy and the introduction of policy measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, concerns are emerging about the sustainability of these market designs. In Australia, wholesale electricity prices have increased markedly – the result of a ‘disorderly’ transition away from coal to new renewable energy. This paper critically examines the ‘energy-only’ market in a high-penetration renewables system, with a particular focus on the vertically and horizontally restructured National Electricity Market (NEM). We propose that the ‘energy-only’ market can indeed work within a decarbonised energy system. But as renewables increasingly replace coal-fired power stations, ‘unintended consequences’ will need to be addressed to facilitate an ‘orderly’ transition. It will be important that policy ensures appropriate new investment in firm capacity is forthcoming; and pricing outcomes are acceptable given political economy constraints. © 2018 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","climate change; energy-only markets; market design; renewables","alternative energy; climate change; electricity generation; emission control; energy market; energy policy; greenhouse gas; political economy","(2016) Interim Report: System Security Market Frameworks Review, , AEMC Publication, Sydney; Besser, J., Farr, J., Tierney, S., The political economy of long-term generation adequacy: why an ICAP mechanism is needed as part of standard market design (2002) The Electricity Journal, 15, pp. 53-62; Bidwell, M., Henney, A., (2004) Will NETA ensure generation adequacy?, , Power UK, 122, April; (2013) Resource adequacy requirements: reliability and economic implications, , www.ferc.gov/legal/staff-reports/2014/02-07-14-consultant-report.pdf, Report prepared for FERC, Available from URL, [accessed 17 February 2017]; Bushnell, J., (2011) Building blocks: investment in renewable and non-renewable technologies, , Energy Institute at Haas Working Paper, 202, Berkeley, California; (2016) Using renewables to operate a low-carbon grid, , CAL-ISO Publication, Sacramento; Caplan, E., What drives new generation construction?

In line with previous research, the introduction of forward markets decreases price variability in comparison to a spot market. However, we also observe that lags in investment decisions and the failure to fully replace retired capacity create capacity investments cycles even in the presence a forward market. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cobweb model; Complexity; Cournot markets; Electricity markets; Forward markets","electricity supply; energy market; investment; modeling; price dynamics","Allaz, B., Vila, J., Cournot competition, forward markets and efficiency (1993) J.

Other papers have since extended on this idea. However, it is cumbersome for newcomers to get an overview of these capacity remuneration mechanism efforts, chiefly because the papers use different names ('reliability options', 'option contracts' and 'forward reliability markets' to name a few) for what is the same mechanism in its basic form. This paper provides a review of these papers, presents an intuitive introduction to the basic underlying mechanism, and highlights the differences between the various approaches.

Most capacity market designs are focused on long term horizons. We develop an optimization-based framework for clearing the capacity market over a short-term horizon. Participation strategy for generation units with firm capacity based on long-run marginal pricing is analyzed. Based on a German case study, we compare three different market frameworks: a proposed short-term capacity clearing process, a long-term capacity clearing process, and an electricity-only market. Results show that, under perfect competition assumptions, generation units that are necessary to maintain the level of supply adequacy deemed by the TSO, are able to recover their total costs under both short-term and long-term clearing, while the energy-only approach cannot ensure long-term supply adequacy. We also show that clearing the capacity market in short term horizons will decrease the cost of ensuring adequate supply by about 28 %. © 2018 IEEE.","Adequacy of supply; Capacity market; Capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM); Power system economics; RES integration","Competition; Power markets; Adequacy of supply; Capacity markets; Capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM); Electrical energy systems; Generation units; Marginal pricing; Perfect competition; Power system economics; Commerce","Sensfuß, F., Ragwitz, M., Genoese, M., The merit-order effect: A detailed analysis of the price effect of renewable electricity generation on spot market prices in Germany (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (8), pp. 3086-3094; Joskow, P.L., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 159-170; Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., Economics and design of capacity markets for the power sector (2012) Zeitschrift Für Energiewirtschaft, 36 (2), pp. 113-134; Capacity remuneration mechanisms and the internal market for electricity (2013) Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators Report, , jul; De Vries, L.J., Generation adequacy: Helping the market do its job (2007) Utilities Policy, 15 (1), pp. 20-35; (2014) Assessment of Electricity Generation Adequacy in European Countries, , Council of European Energy Regulators, Tech.

In Italy, a capacity market is expected to start within the end of this year, based on sequential descending marginal price auctions, in which reliability options are exchanged between the TSO and the capacity suppliers. After discussing the potential risks of the market design, we perform an explicit simulation of the first auction: the demand curve is estimated through a stochastic simulation of the expected market scenario, based on main drivers' volatility, while some possible approaches for the estimation of the offer curve are discussed, based on the opportunity costs to participate in the capacity auctions. We conclude that the market design is characterized by strong uncertainties and only a consistent definition of economic parameters can drive a fair participation of suppliers, necessary to result in the most efficient solution for the system evolution. © 2018 IEEE.","Capacity Auctions; Capacity Remuneration; Missing Money; Security of Supply","Power markets; Risk perception; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Capacity auctions; Capacity Remuneration; Economic parameters; European Countries; Missing Money; Opportunity costs; Security of supply; Stochastic simulations; Commerce","(2016) Identification of Appropriate Generation and System Adequacy Standards for the Internal Electricity Market, , European Commission. final report; Poncela Blanco, M., Spisto, A., Hrelja, N., Fulli, G., Generation adequacy methodology review (2016) JRC Science for Policy Report; Resolution ARG/elt 98/11, Consultation 713/2016/R/eel, Consultation 592/17/R/eel, Resolution 261/2018/R/eel by Italian NRA; Disciplina Mercato della Capacità-prima Attuazione, , document for consultation held by Terna; Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., (2012) Economics and Design of Capacity Markets for the Power Sector, , mimeo, University of Maryland; Salant, D., Stoddard, R., (2008) Auction Design for Capacity Markets Fifth Conference on the Economics of Energy Markets, , Toulouse, France, June 20-21; Joskow, P.L., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 159-170; Oren, S.S., Generation adequacy via call option obligations: Safe passage to the promised land (2005) The Electricity Journal, 18 (9), pp. 28-42; Bidwell, M., Reliability options (2005) The Electricity Journal, 18 (5), pp. 11-25; Harbord, D., Pagnozzi, M., Britain's electricity capacity auctions: Lessons from Colombia and new England (2014) The Electricity Journal, 27 (5), pp. 54-62; Wolak, F., (2004) What's Wrong with Capacity Markets, , mimeo, Stanford University; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense (2005) The Electricity Journal, 18 (7), pp. 43-54",,,"IEEE Computer Society",21654077,9781538614884,,,"English","Int.

Replacing, partially or totally, the scarcity rent by a fixed annual capacity remuneration stabilizes revenues and mechanically lowers the risk premium required by investors. Numerous studies using numerical or analytical models compare the performance of systems with CRM to alternative market designs. The diversity of methods and results makes it difficult for non specialists to have a comprehensive view on CRMs efficiency. This analysis attempts to synthesize the current literature to assess whether the results of a panel of 23 papers indicate an improvement in investment conditions with capacity remuneration. The efficiency of market designs is assessed through the mainstream concerns in the literature: security of supply, welfare, price volatility and investment cycles performances. Our effort highlights the difficulty of capturing the issue of CRMs in a single unifying framework. The 23 studies analyzed do not converge towards one simple conclusion. Surprisingly, modeling decisions have little impact on results. Most studies in our panel agree on the efficiency of CRMs to reduce both price volatility and investment cycles compared to the energy only market. With respect to security of supply (SoS) and consumer surplus, the effects are overall beneficial although less consensual, mainly due to heterogeneous definition of SoS and surplus. With this respect, a more systematic effort of the research community to develop a common approach and language would certainly help advancing our understanding of CRMs further and send clearer signals to power systems regulators. © 2018 IEEE.","Power generation planning; Power systems","Commerce; Energy security; Power markets; Standby power systems; Systems engineering; Consumer surplus; Energy-only market; Investment incentives; Modeling decisions; Performance of systems; Power generation planning; Research communities; Security of supply; Investments","Koppelaar, R.H.E.M., Keirstead, J., Shah, N., Woods, J., A review of policy analysis purpose and capabilities of electricity system models (2016) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, , https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1364032116001209/1-s2.0-S1364032116001209-main.pdf?{\_}tid=2f92fec8-05f0-11e8-829e-00000aacb35f{\&}acdnat=1517339158{\_}9dbfd660c2b13ad5a8f10102c0490281; Bucksteeg, M., Spiecker, S., Weber, C., (2017) Impact of Coordinated Capacity Mechanisms on the European Power Market, , http://hdl.handle.net/10419/162994; Mastropietro, P., Herrero, I., Rodilla, P., Batlle, C., A model-based analysis on the impact of explicit penalty schemes in capacity mechanisms (2016) Applied Energy, , http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0306261916300964/1-s2.0-S0306261916300964-main.pdf?{\_}tid=2e3a9d80-897f-11e7-b92d-00000aacb361{\&}acdnat=1503656679{\_}53dbf090f03537d0b641bbf6f024da0a; Kim, H., Kim, S.-S., The resource adequacy scheme in the Korean electricity market (2012) Energy Policy, 47. , https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0301421512003400/1-s2.0-S0301421512003400-main.pdf?{\_}tid=eb5c9edc-f16b-11e7-af9b-00000aab0f6b{\&}acdnat=1515083327{\_}2d63e3ad65eccdc3fdbb6dfcc5ad7937; Devine, M.T., Lynch, M.Á., Inducing truthful revelation of generator reliability (2017) Energy Economics, 64, pp. 186-195. , http://ac.els-cdn.com/S014098831730083X/1-s2.0-S014098831730083X-main.pdf?{\_}tid=8ff59caa-8993-11e7-9284-00000aacb35d{\&}acdnat=1503665433{\_}e3ab6130fc2f43c844c7c1e1fac4e721; Henriot, A., Glachant, J.-M., Melting-pots and salad bowls: The current debate on electricity market design for integration of intermittent RES (2013) Utilities Policy, 27, pp. 57-64. , http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0957178713000520/1-s2.0-S0957178713000520-main.pdf?{\_}tid=75032e4c-899f-11e7-8c64-00000aab0f01{\&}acdnat=1503670541{\_}26e00f90383bcdbf9e0f7301dad16980; Meulman, L., Méray, N., Capacity mechanisms in nortwest Europe-between a rock and a hard place (2012) Clingendael International Energy Programme; Hogan, W.W., (2005) On An Energy only Electricity Market Design for Resource Adequacy, , https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/fs/whogan/Hogan{\_}Energy{\_}Only{\_}092305.pdf; De Maere, G., Ehrenmann, A., Smeers, Y., Investment with incomplete markets for risk: The need for long-term contracts (2017) Energy Policy, 105, pp. 571-583. , http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0301421517300411/1-s2.0-S0301421517300411-main.pdf?{\_}tid=42a50bd0-8e5b-11e7-8726-00000aacb361{\&}acdnat=1504191007{\_}e6b15e580e6131e3da7617cc942404a9; (2014) FRENCH CAPACITY MARKET Report Accompanying the Draft Rules, , http://www.rte-france.com/sites/default/files/2014{\_}04{\_}09{\_}french{\_}capacity{\_}market.pdf, RTE.

Hence, it is in a current state of transition between the traditional approach to power generation and distribution, where end-consumers of electricity have typically been inactive in their involvement with energy markets and a new approach that integrates their active participation. This new approach includes the use of distributed energy resources (DER) such as renewable-based generation and demand response (DR), which are being rapidly adopted by end-consumers where incentives are strong. This paper presents the role of the DR aggregator to effectively integrate DER technology as a new source of energy capacity into electricity networks using information communication technology and industry knowledge., Based on DR aggregators, this framework will efficiently facilitate renewable energy integration and customer engagement into the electricity market. To this aim, advantages and disadvantages of DR aggregators are discussed in this paper from political, economic, social, and technological (PEST) points of view. Based on this analysis, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis for a typical DR aggregator is presented. © 2018 by the authors.

In addition to the well-known missing money problem in electricity markets, increasing penetration levels of stochastic resources pose new challenges to system planners in achieving least-cost resource adequacy. As a result, various capacity remuneration mechanisms are considered to promote sufficient capacity investments. This work is envisioned to provide insights into how different capacity remuneration mechanisms and uncertainty associated with the stochastic resources can affect investment and retirement decisions of individual profit-maximizing generation companies as well as system-wide resource adequacy. The numerical analysis illustrates potential use and effectiveness of the presented modeling framework. © 2018 IEEE.","Behavioral modeling; Capacity market; Capacity payment; Capacity remuneration mechanisms; Complementarity modeling; Stochastic generation expansion planning","Commerce; Investments; Multi agent systems; Renewable energy resources; Resource allocation; Stochastic models; Behavioral model; Capacity markets; Capacity payments; Complementarity models; Stochastic generation; Stochastic systems","Joskow, P.L., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2018) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 159-170. , Sep; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., (2006) The Convergence of Market Designs for Adequate Generating Capacity with Special Attention to the CAISO's Resource Adequacy Problem, , http://www.cramton.umd.edu/papers2005-2009/cramton-stoft-market-design-for-resource-adequacy.pdf, Apr; Keppler, J.H., Rationales for capacity remuneration mechanisms: Security of supply externalities and asymmetric investment incentives (2017) Energy Policy, 105, pp. 562-570. , June; Ela, E., Milligan, M., Bloom, A., Botterud, A., Townsend, A., Levin, T., (2014) Evolution of Wholesale Electricity Market Design with Increasing Levels of Renewable Generation, , National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, Tech.

This challenge is becoming even more relevant as power generation is increasingly based on renewables that are intermittent and seasonally dependent. In this context, policy makers and regulators implement capacity mechanisms that seek to overcome the intrinsic shortcomings of renewables. Failing to do so, given the uncertainty and complexity involved, means either that excessive overcapacity will become persistent and remain idle, or that under-capacity will prompt blackouts and high electricity prices. To help manage the uncertainty and complexity, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the effects of the capacity mechanism on electricity markets with a high share of hydropower – by using a system dynamics modelling approach applied to Colombia. In the past, though the capacity mechanism induced large reserve margins, the system has been at serious risk of experience blackouts and has resulted in extremely high electricity prices over a prolonged period. In the future, worse scenarios are possible: historically-familiar events – when backup plants were not available – may recur when new capacity is delayed, posing an even greater threat to the system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity mechanisms; Electricity markets; Security of supply; Simulation","Commerce; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Power markets; Uncertainty analysis; Capacity investment; Electricity prices; Over capacity; Power industry; Security of supply; Simulation; System dynamics modelling; Uncertainty and complexity; Outages; complexity; energy market; hydroelectric power; investment; policy making; power generation; price dynamics; simulation; uncertainty analysis; Colombia","Newbery, D., (2002) Regulatory challenges to European electricity liberalisation, 9, pp. 9-43; Stoft, S., Power system economics designing markets for electricity (2002), A John Wiley & Sons, Inc California; Olsina, F., Garcés, F., Haubrich, H.-J., Modeling long-term dynamics of electricity markets (2006) Energy Pol, 34, pp. 1411-1433; Batlle, C., Rodilla, P., A critical assessment of the different approaches aimed to secure electricity generation supply (2010) Energy Pol, 38, pp. 7169-7179; Castro-Rodriguez, F., Marín, P.L., Siotis, G., Capacity choices in liberalised electricity markets (2009) Energy Pol, 37, pp. 2574-2581; Osorio, S., van Ackere, A., From nuclear phase-out to renewable ENERGIES IN the swiss electricity market (2016) Energy Pol, 93, pp. 8-22; Pereira, A.J.C., Saraiva, J.T., Generation expansion planning (GEP) – a long-term approach using system dynamics and genetic algorithms (GAs) (2011) Energy, 36, pp. 5180-5199; Bunn, D.W., Oliveira, F.S., (2007) Agent-based analysis of technological diversification and specialization in electricity markets, 181, pp. 1265-1278; Newbery, D., Market design.

This responsibility is dedicated to Ancillary Services (AS) that, in perspective to market liberalization, is the accountability of the System Operators (SO) to secure the requisite level of quality and safety. In the liberalized environment, AS are disaggregated from the energy generation, and can be obligated or compensated under market processes. SO seeks specific ways to define, procure and implement such services by managing active power for adjusting the frequency and reactive power for sustaining sufficient voltage profile throughout the arrangement. A comprehensive analysis of several techno-economical aspects of AS in liberalized electricity markets of a developed economy and emerging economies has been reviewed in this work. While attending the wide range of AS, the aim is to provide the promising knowledge of individual service by comparing different AS markets that exists worldwide, showing similarities and conflicts between various market models. Apart from conventional providers of AS, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in several liberalized electricity markets seem to be a good provider of AS along with energy in order to maximize their revenue from these marketplaces. In addition to their types and definition, participation, contracting approach, selection of offers, dispatch criterion along with renewable energy participation in various electricity markets has been discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ancillary services market; Assessment mechanism; Competitive electricity market; Renewable energy sources; Trading mechanism","Deregulation; Natural resources; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Ancillary services markets; Assessment mechanism; Competitive electricity markets; Renewable energy source; Trading mechanism; Commerce","Banshwar, A., Sharma, N.K., Sood, Y.R., Shrivastava, R., Market based procurement of energy and ancillary services from renewable energy sources in deregulated environment (2017) Renew Energy, 101, pp. 1390-1400; Bhattacharya, K., Bollen, M., Daalder, J., Operation of restructured power systems (2001), Kluwer Academic Publishers Boston; Hirst, E., Kirby, B., (1996), http://www.consultkirby.com/files/con433_AS_Details_Reg_LF_Gen_Resp.pdf, Ancillary-service details: regulation, load following and generator response [Online].

Individual availability of supply is uncertain and may exhibit dependencies with other suppliers as well as with the stochastic demand. Aiming at a comprehensive and consistent reliability assessment, we first investigate the system as a whole, and then derive a general solution for an individual supplier's contribution. Implicitly, we identify changing returns to scale, gains of diversification, and non-additivity. As these properties are often undesirable, e.g., for the purpose of accounting or in specific auction formats, we build on concepts from cooperative game theory to provide the Shapley value as the unique consistent reliability allocation rule. We then illustrate practical relevance and applicability of our approach for the case of wind power contributing to the reliability of Germany's electricity system, and discuss how today's reliability mechanisms may be improved by considering interdependencies between suppliers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cooperative game theory; Electric power industry; OR in energy; Reliability of supply; Stochastic interdependency","Electric industry; Game theory; Reliability; Reliability theory; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Cooperative game theory; Electric power industries; OR in energy; Reliability of supply; Stochastic interdependency; Power quality","(2014), http://www.foederal-erneuerbar.de/uebersicht/kategorie/wind/bundeslaender/BW|BY|B|BB|HB|HH|HE|MV|NI|NRW|RLP|SL|SN|ST|SH|TH|D., Yearly power generation from wind energy per federal state.

The debate focuses on how the capacity markets will be smoothly integrated in one Pan-European power market, without resulting in multiple national fragmentations and consequently in economic efficiency losses. Cross-border participation and regional cooperation are considered as two sine qua non conditions in this respect. The present paper provides a coalitional game theoretical approach aiming to facilitate the cooperation of neighboring countries, when it comes to the security of electricity supply and the necessity of establishing a capacity market. Such an approach can support respective decisions about capacity markets cooperation as well as stress-test the benefits considering all cooperation possibilities. © 2018 by the authors.","Adequacy; Capacity market; Characteristic function; Coalitional games; Cooperation; Decision support; Myerson value; Nucleolus; Proportional division","Decision support systems; Game theory; Power markets; Adequacy; Capacity markets; Characteristic functions; Coalitional game; Cooperation; Decision supports; Myerson value; Nucleolus; Proportional division; Commerce","Joskow, P., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2008) Utilities Police, 16, pp. 159-170; Chattopadhyay, D., Alpcan, T., Capacity and energy-only markets under high renewable penetration (2016) IEEE Trans.

This paper examines countries' unilateral incentives to achieve supply security through capacity reserves and market integration in a multinational electricity market. Capacity reserves protect consumers against blackouts and extreme prices, but distort the market. Market integration reduces supply imbalances, but requires network investment. Equilibrium capacity reserves can be too high or low, but network investment is always insufficient relative to the total welfare maximizing level. Capacity reserves are smaller when there are financial markets or when aimed at solving domestic supply constraints. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity mechanism; Decentralized policy making; Multinational electricity market; Network investment; Security of supply","Commerce; Electric industry; Network security; Power markets; Capacity reserves; Decentralized policies; Domestic supplies; Electricity demands; Market integration; Network investment; Security of supply; Variable renewable energies; Investments; alternative energy; decentralization; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy market; investment; multinational enterprise; policy making","Bessembinder, H., Lemmon, M.L., Equilibrium pricing and optional hedging in electricity forward markets (2002) J.

The addition of intermittent renewable generation is thought to make conditions harder. In this article, optimal VoLL events in an islanded NEM region is modelled by substituting high price caps for Boiteux capacity charges, then analysing the impact of adding progressively more Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) – up to 35% market share. Spot market conditions prove stable and tractable provided thermal plant exit and adjust perfectly. But VRE asset allocation is important; absent highly elastic demand or ultra-low cost storage, solar PV market share has economic limits because the technology rapidly cannibalises itself. Furthermore, as VRE rises in imperfectly interconnected regions, a tipping point appears to exist where hedge markets enter an unstable zone through shortages of ‘asset-backed’ firm intra-regional swaps and caps. Government-initiated CfDs for VRE need to be designed carefully to ensure any instability is not exacerbated by extracting contracts from an already shortening hedge market. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy markets; Missing money; Variable renewable energy","Competition; Investments; Power markets; Wooden fences; Asset allocation; Energy markets; Energy-only market; Missing money; National electricity markets; Renewable generation; Unstable equilibriums; Variable renewable energies; Commerce; alternative energy; demand elasticity; electricity generation; energy market; photovoltaic system; solar power; thermal power; Australia","Acemoglu, D., Kakhbod, A., Ozdaglar, A., Competition in electricity markets with renewable energy sources (2017) Energy J., 38 (S11), pp. 137-155; Agranat, O., MacGill, I., Bruce, A., Fast frequency markets under high penetrations of renewable energy in the Australian National Electricity Market (2015) 2015 Asia-Pacific Solar Research Conference; Allaz, B., Vila, J.-L., Cournot competition, futures markets and efficiency (1993) J.

The aspect of the vehicles of changeable locations is taken as the basis to obtain a defined mobility pattern, with home and work being selected as the operational places to perform G2V and V2G activities. The presented approach assisted in achieving peak shaving and valley filling (MW) of a typical two-peak daily load curve of a real system to a considerable extent, thereby levelling the load and reducing the complexities associated with the forecasting and dispatch of the oscillating load. The reduction in the ramp up and ramp down energy and reserve requirements (MW), as well as the cost savings associated with reduced generation ramping commitments, as seen from system operator's perspective, is quantified with the proposed schemes. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of flattening a realistic amount of load. The associated cost savings with reduced ramping requirements from traditional sources can be allocated to participating vehicles for providing the grid services. The benefits derived can encourage their adoption which is contained due to its expensiveness in the current market scenario, apart from increasing the grid reliability. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.","and valley filling; grid-to-vehicle (G2V); load levelling; peak shaving; Vehicle-to-grid (V2G)","Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Electric vehicles; Vehicles; Battery storage system; Discharging phasis; Grid to vehicle (G2V); Load levelling; Peak shaving; Ramping requirements; Reserve requirements; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Electric machine control","(2011) International Electrotechnical Commission, , http://www.iec.ch/whitepaper/energystorage/, IEC.

The model is based on an iterative procedure of finding an equilibrium electricity price forecast closely depicting real-world investor behavior. We assess the robustness and the total cost of generation of a capacity market compared to an energy-only market as capacity markets are increasingly considered worldwide due to market imperfections and rising feed-in from renewables. To estimate unplanned unavailabilities, we analyze a novel data set of the European Energy Exchange describing unplanned unavailability incidents. Applying the model to the Great Britain market, we find that capacity markets are more robust to unplanned unavailabilities of conventional generation in terms of the total cost of generation and price volatility. At the same time, capacity markets induce additional costs through capacity payments. Therefore, we jointly analyze the total cost of generation and the robustness with different levels of reserve margins. Our results show that there is a promising area of efficient trade-offs between costs and robustness in the range of reserve margins between 0 and 15%. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Capacity mechanism; Electricity market; Generation adequacy; Stochastic electricity capacity expansion model; Uncertainty; Unplanned unavailability",,"Baldick, R., Helman, U., Hobbs, B.F., O’Neill, R.P., Design of efficient generation markets (2005) Proc IEEE, 93, pp. 1998-2012; Power plant capacity payments inevitable in Germany (2013) UBS Says, , http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-23/power-plant-capacity-payments-inevitable-in-germany-ubs-says.html, Accessed 23 Apr 2013; Borenstein, S., Bushnell, J., Knittel, C.R., Market power in electricity markets: beyond concentration measures (1999) Energy J, 20, pp. 65-83; Bunn, D.W., Oliveira, F.S., Modeling the impact of market interventions on the strategic evolution of electricity markets (2008) Oper Res, 56, pp. 1116-1130; Bushnell, J.B., Mansur, E.T., Saravia, C., Vertical arrangements, market structure, and competition: an analysis of restructured US electricity markets (2008) Am Econ Rev, 98, pp. 237-266; Cepeda, M., Finon, D., How to correct for long-term externalities of large-scale wind power development by a capacity mechanism?

However, there are issues on the welfare of the generators involved. In context of Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry, this paper proposes a model, a pool hybrid introducing the minimum capacity payment involving the efficiency of the generators and base load sharing approaches. Under single auction power pool, a case study is conducted for the generators in Peninsular Malaysia for an economic analysis to highlight the merits of the proposed model compared with other pool-based market models in terms of generation revenue and demand payment. The load demand curves, the details of the MW-installed capacity, energy prices, capacity prices, and efficiency of the generators are the parameters taken into account in carry out analysis on each generator revenue. Results have shown that pool hybrid market ensures the intermediate value of generation revenue with all Independent Power Producers participation even at the lowest demand and decreased the demand payment. © 2018, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","capacity payment; efficiency; electricity supply industry (ESI); pool market","Commerce; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Electric utilities; Capacity payments; Economic benefits; Energy prices; Independent power producers; Installed capacity; Market model; Pool markets; Power pools; Lakes","Galetovic, A., Muñoz, C.M., Wolak, F.A., Capacity payments in a cost-based wholesale electricity market: the case of Chile (2015) Electricity J., 28 (10), pp. 80-96. , December, and; Olsina, F., Pringles, R., Larisson, C., Garcés, F., Reliability payments to generation capacity in electricity markets (2014) Energy Policy, 73, pp. 211-224. , October, and; Dahlan, N.Y., Valuation model for generation investment in liberalised electricity market (2011) Ph.D. dissertation, , Dept.

Low levels of both European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) allowance prices and wholesale power prices fuelled concerns over drivers for decarbonisation and long-term generation adequacy. Whilst some countries have introduced capacity remuneration mechanisms to ensure generation adequacy, reforming the EU ETS has proven to be difficult. This paper proposes a unilateral approach by a state introducing a CO2 levy that internalises and prices CO2 at a national level. The suggested climate and supply market model thereby incentivises and rewards production from CO2-neutral sources during times when it does not cover the targeted share of production. Prior to describing the model in detail, this paper discusses the theoretical policy steering background and the problems associated with current energy policies. For a broader picture, other CO2 taxation models are briefly presented. This is followed by a discussion on the legal aspects of the model, its compatibility with international as well as EU law. The model is explored further by using Switzerland as an example, showing that a crosssector carbon price can be implemented at acceptable costs for consumers. Last but not least, the paper examines varieties of the model and the adaption potential for European countries. © The Author(s) 2019.","Border tax; Carbon tax; Climate policy; CO2 levy; Emission trading; Energy policy; EU ETS; Security of supply","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; International law; Taxation; Border tax; Carbon taxes; Climate policy; CO2 levy; Emission trading; Security of supply; Climate models","Abbott, M., Is the security of electricity supply a public good?

This paper examines whether RES-E shares should be measured based on consumption rather than production with a European case study presented for the year 2030. The case study demonstrates the volume and scale of RES-E transfers and shows how countries have differing RES-E shares when comparing those derived based on the traditional production-based approach to the alternative. The proposed consumption-based approach accounts for RES-E being imported and exported on an hourly basis across 30 European countries and highlights concerns regarding uncoordinated support mechanisms, price distortions and cost inequality. These concerns are caused by cross-border subsidisation of electricity and this work proposes that an agency be appointed to administer regional RES-E affairs. This agency would accurately quantify RES-E shares and remunerate producers from the country that consumed their electricity instead of where it has been produced – policy would be enhanced by enabling more equitable and optimal electricity decarbonisation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption-based renewable electricity quantification; Cross-border subsidisation; EU Target Model; Member State RES-E targets","Energy policy; Cross-border; Decarbonisation; European Countries; Large parts; Renewable electricity; Support mechanism; Target model; Electric power system interconnection; alternative energy; electricity generation; energy use; European Union; export; import; subsidy system; Europe","Bahar, H., Sauvage, J., (2013), Cross-Border Trade in Electricity and the Development of Renewables-Based Electric Power: Lessons from Europe.

Since 2014, it has been developing and implementing an energy strategy that responds to the three overarching priorities of climate change, political security, and economic competitiveness by 2030. The European Energy Union aims to provide secure, sustainable and affordable energy throughout the cycle of production, transport and consumption. This book outlines the legal regime underpinning this regulatory strategy, which integrates EU law with international law and with the law of the member states and affiliated states. It analyses and explains the increasing interaction between these legal orders in achieving the shared objective of transforming the European and global energy systems. This book will appeal to scholars and students of energy law and Policy at both European and international levels. © Volker Roeben, 2018.",,,"(2014) Fifth Assessment Report on Climate Change (AR5), p. 1. , www.ipcc.ch, Synthesis Report; Wanga, F.F., Yinb, H., Li, S., China’s Renewable Energy Policy: Commitments and Challenges (2010) Energy Policy, 38, p. 1872; Martinot, E., Renewable Power for China: Past, Present, and Future (2010) Frontiers in Energy, 4, p. 287; Energy Policies of IEA Countries: The United States 2014 Review, , www.iea.org; Curtis, T., Unravelling the US Shale Productivity Gains (2016) OIES Paper WPM, 69; Buchan, D., (2014) Costs, Competitiveness and Climate Policy, Distortions across Europe, , www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Costs-Competitiveness-and-Climate-Policy.pdf; Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report 2014: Market Analysis and Forecasts to 2020 and World Energy Outlook 2016; (2011) Energy Resource Potential of Methane Hydrate, , www.netl.doe.gov/File%20Library/Research/Oil-Gas/methane%20hydrates/MH-Primer2011.pdf; Strategic Energy Plan 2014, , www.enecho.meti.go.jp/en/category/others/basic_plan/pdf/4th_strategic_energy_plan.pdf; (2011) Offshore Transmission Technology, p. 24. , www.entsoe.eu/resources/publications/system-development/north-seas-griddevelopment; Duff, A., Law, Strategy and Democracy (2009) Journal of Applied Philosophy, 26, p. 269; Vermeule, A., Three Strategies of Interpretation (2005) San Diego Law Review, 65, p. 312; Freedman, L., (2013) Strategy, pp. 607-629. , Oxford University Press; Halpin, A., (2009) Law as Institutional Normative Order: Essays in Honour of Sir Neil MacCormick, pp. 45 and 47. , M.

Particularly in the last decade, security of supply has become a major issue for policymakers due to a number of changes in technology, especially the introduction of renewables, where regulators have introduced capacity mechanisms. In this paper, we focus on the use of two different capacity mechanisms: procurement for long-term strategic reserves contracting, and centralized auctioning for capacity contracts. We investigate the effect of uncertainty on the effectiveness of these two mechanisms in maintaining a stable and sufficient supply of capacity. We use simulation to establish the behavior as the level of uncertainty is increased. Our results suggest that a market's level of uncertainty plays an important role in the effectiveness of these two interventions. The results raise questions about when it is appropriate to introduce either of them. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adequacy of supply; Capacity mechanisms; Centralized auctions; Security of supply; Strategic reserves; Uncertainty","Commerce; Deregulation; Adequacy of supply; Centralized auctions; Security of supply; Strategic reserves; Uncertainty; Power markets","Helm, D., The New Energy Paradigm (2007), Oxford University Press; Larsen, E.R., Bunn, D.W., Deregulation in electricity: understanding strategic and regulatory risk (1999) J.

The reliability analysis of the variants of development of electric power system is carried out on the base of the Monte Carlo method. The profit of generating companies is calculated by the obtained reliability indexes which characterize some variant of electric power system development.

An agent-based model is used for this analysis. Capacity markets can compensate for the deteriorating incentive to invest in controllable power plants when the share of variable renewable energy sources grows, but may create volatile prices themselves. Capacity markets with long-term contracts have been developed, e.g. in the UK, to stabilize capacity prices. In our analysis, a FCM is effective in providing the required adequacy level and leads to lower cost to consumers and more stable capacity prices, as compared to a yearly capacity market. In case of a demand shock, a FCM may develop an investment cycle, but it still maintains security of supply. Its main effect on the power plant portfolio is more investment in peak plant. © 2017 The Author(s)","Adequacy policy; Agent-based modeling; Capacity markets; Capacity mechanisms; Electricity market; Security of supply","Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Electric industry; Energy security; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Agent-based model; Capacity markets; Investment cycle; Long-term contracts; Power plant portfolio; Renewable energies; Security of supply; Variable renewable energies; Investments; demand elasticity; electricity supply; energy market; incentive; investment; modeling; price dynamics; renewable resource; United Kingdom","(2013), Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms and the Internal Market for Electricity; Anderson, R., Taylor, L., The social cost of unsupplied electricity (1986) Energy Econ., 8, pp. 139-146; Baarsma, B.E., Hop, J.P., Pricing power outages in the Netherlands (2009) Energy, 34, pp. 1378-1386; Beurskens, L.W.M., Hekkenberg, M., Vethman, P., (2011), http://dx.doi.org/ECN-E–10-069, Renewable energy projections as published in the national renewable energy action plans of the European member states (JOUR). 〈〉; Bhagwat, P.C., Security of Supply during the Energy Transition: The Role of Capacity Mechanisms (2016), Delft University of Technology Delft; Bhagwat, P.C., Iychettira, K., de Vries, L.J., (2014), pp. 1-5. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EEM.2014.6861269, Cross-border effects of capacity mechanisms.

This target policy produces volatile prices that can make investing in renewables a risky proposition. In this paper, we propose an alternative policy called Adjustable Dynamic Assignment of Penalties and Targets (ADAPT) that uses a sloped compliance penalty and a self-regulating requirement schedule, both designed to stabilize REC prices, helping to alleviate a common weakness of environmental markets. To capture market behavior, we model the market as a stochastic dynamic programming problem to understand how the market might balance the decision to use a REC now versus holding it for future periods (in the face of uncertain new supply). Then, we present and prove some of the properties of this market, and finally we show that this mechanism reduces the volatility of REC prices, which should stabilize the market and encourage long-term investment in renewables. © 2017 INFORMS.","Compliance policy; Mechanism design; Price volatility; Renewable energy certificates; Stochastic dynamic programming","Commerce; Compliant mechanisms; Costs; Dynamic programming; Dynamics; Functions; Machine design; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Demand function; Dynamic assignment; Environmental market; Long-term investment; Mechanism design; Price volatility; Renewable energy certificates; Stochastic dynamic programming; Investments","Amundsen, E., Baldursson, F., Mortensen, J., Price volatility and banking in green certificate markets (2006) Environ.

Specifically, the economic rationale behind world-wide wind power deployment is to mitigate negative externalities of conventional electricity technologies, notably emissions from fossil fuels. However, wind power entails externalities itself. Wind turbines can lower quality of human life through noise and visual impacts, and threaten wildlife. Variable wind electricity can impose additional costs within the electricity system. Locally and nationally, employment, output, and security of electricity supply can be affected.

Implementation of a capacity market can improve supply adequacy and reduce consumer costs. It mainly leads to more investment in low-cost peak generation units. If the administratively determined reserve margin is high enough, the security of supply is not significantly affected by uncertainties or demand shocks. A capacity market is found to be more effective than a strategic reserve for ensuring reliability. © 2017 The Authors","Adequacy policy; Capacity markets; Security of supply","alternative energy; energy market; energy policy; renewable resource","Anderson, R., Taylor, L., The social cost of unsupplied electricity (1986) Energy Econ., 8, pp. 139-146; Baarsma, B.E., Hop, J.P., Pricing power outages in The Netherlands (2009) Energy, 34, pp. 1378-1386; Bhagwat, P.C., Security of Supply during the Energy Transition: the Role of Capacity Mechanisms (2016), Delft University of Technology; Bhagwat, P.C., de Vries, L.J., Hobbs, B.F., Expert survey on capacity markets in the US: lessons for the EU (2016) Util.

The model consists of two layers. Firstly, it proposes calculation methods of long-run marginal cost of transmission reliability through deep analysis of the electricity transmission cost, and a user transmission pricing model is built considering reliability based on the grid using extent and long-run marginal cost of transmission reliability. Secondly, a transmission revenue distribution model is constructed considering investment of transmission lines and its reliability contribution, and an economic incentive model of fine fund is established and induced for excessive transmission investment. With the selection of the unified pricing mechanism, the model overcomes the shortcomings of the multi-level overlay pricing method (MLO) and the point of connection tariff (POC) which cannot clearly reflect the insufficient use of the power grid by the transmission devices of cross-regional transactions. And the model is fairer, simpler and more transparent to settle accounts. By introducing reliability component, it is able to provide economic signals of transmission congestion and to effectively guide transmission investment. Results of IEEE 57-bus test system illustrate its rationality and effectiveness. © 2017 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","Cross-regional transaction; Transmission pricing; Transmission reliability; Unified pricing mechanism","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Investments; Power markets; Power quality; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Cross-regional transaction; Electricity transmission; Pricing mechanism; Revenue distributions; Transmission congestion; Transmission investments; Transmission pricing; Transmission reliability; Electric power system interconnection","Olmos, L., Perez-Arriaga, I.J., Evaluation of three methods proposed for the computation of inter-TSO payments in the internal electricity markets of the European Union (2007) IEEE Trans on Power Systems, 22 (4), pp. 1507-1522; Wang, Q., Zhang, L., Xie, G., A transmission pricing mechanism for cross-regional electricity trading (2010) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 34 (13), pp. 11-15; Reta, R., Vargas, A., Comparative analysis of methodologies for allocating transmissions costs applied to international interconnections (2006) 2006 IEEE PES Transmission & Distribution Conference and Exposition, , August 15-18, Caracas, Latin America: 6p; Kaisa, K., Pricing of electricity distribution: an empirical efficiency study in Finland, Norway and Sweden (2005) Utilities Policy, 13 (1), pp. 15-25; Bialek, J.W., Tracing-based unifying framework for transmission pricing of cross-border trades in Europe (2000) Proceedings of 2000 Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies, , April 4-7, London, UK: 6p; Gil, H.A., Galiana, F.D., Conejo, A.J., Multiarea transmission network cost allocation (2005) IEEE Trans on Power Systems, 20 (3), pp. 1293-1301; Lima, J.W.M., Allocation of transmission fixed charges: an overview (1996) IEEE Trans on Power Systems, 11 (3), pp. 1409-1418; Zhou, J., Yuan, Y., Li, Z., Calculation method of nodal price in distribution network considering power supply reliability (2016) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 40 (7), pp. 42-48; Silva, E.L., Mesa, S.E.C., Morozowski, M., Transmission access pricing to wheeling transactions: a reliability based approach (1998) IEEE Trans on Power Systems, 13 (4), pp. 1481-1486; Li, W., Zhou, J., Lu, J., Incorporating reliability component in transmission service rate design (2006) Proceedings of the CSEE, 26 (13), pp. 43-49; Park, Y.H., Kim, D.M., Kim, J.O., Transmission cost allocation considering reliability cost (2008) Transactions of the Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers, 57 (4), pp. 576-581; Li, C., Han, Y., Gao, X., A method to allocate security costs for cross-regional and trans-provincial power transmission (2010) Power System Technology, 34 (12), pp. 174-179; Vijay, V.V., Verma, A.K.A., Probabilistic transmission pricing methodology considering transmission reliability margins (2010) International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management, 1 (2), pp. 113-119; Yu, J., Patton, A.D., Transmission use charges including reliability costs (2000) IEEE 2000 Power Engineering Society Winter Meeting, , January 23-27, Singapore: 6p; Rathore, P., Agnihotri, G., Khan, B., Optimal transmission pricing with reliability indices (2014) IEEE 2014 Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering, , March 6-8, Coimbatore, India: 6p; Yang, Z., Zhong, H., Xia, Q., A structural transmission cost allocation scheme based on capacity usage identification (2016) IEEE Trans on Power Systems, 31 (4), pp. 2876-2884; Zheng, H., How to improve the electricity trading price mechanism of cross-province from international experience (2011) China Price, (3), pp. 55-57; Cheng, H., Zheng, Y., Geng, J., Path optimization model of trans-regional and trans-provincial electricity trade based on expand network flow (2016) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 40 (9), pp. 129-134; Hu, J., Wen, F., Meng, W., Settlement method for inter-provincial electricity trading considering allocations of unbalanced electric quantity (2016) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 40 (18), pp. 135-142; Liu, M., Li, W., Yu, J., Reliability evaluation of tidal and wind power generation system with battery energy storage (2016) Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy, 4 (4), pp. 636-647; Wang, L., Wang, G., Li, B., An optimal load shedding model for AC/DC hybrid transmission system adequacy assessment (2011) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 35 (7), pp. 7-12; Xue, Y., Cai, B., James, G., Primary energy congestion of power systems (2014) Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy, 2 (1), pp. 39-49","Huang, H.; College of Electric Power Engineering, Shanghai University of Electric PowerChina; email: hbdl_huanghaitao@sina.com",,"Automation of Electric Power Systems Press",10001026,,DXZIE,,"Chinese","Dianli Xitong Zidonghue",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031020681

In this regard, natural gas-based technologies and consuming the fuel by demand are two tie points between these systems. System dynamics is a conceptual tool for long-run analysis of dynamic systems, which is based on control theories. This paper employs system dynamics for long-run analysis of the natural gas effect on capacity expansion in the power market. The idea is studied in generation and consumption levels and three scenarios, including (1) stable state, (2) variation of natural gas price and (3) access of demand to natural gas and electricity, are considered. Four generation technologies, namely coal-fired, combined cycle gas turbine, gas turbine and wind, compete in a pay-as-bid energy market using published data by energy information administration. The first scenario is profitable for the whole technologies and provides the reliability. High-charge gas increases the profit and decreases the share of gas-based technologies in the market. Low-charge gas increases the share of gas-based technologies and causes the loss of the firms. Demand access to both energy resources affects the profit and reliability destructively.","Capacity expansion; Natural gas; Power market; System dynamics","Combined cycle power plants; Commerce; Energy resources;

To restore market adequacy, capacity mechanisms (CMs) are widely discussed and implemented in various types. They are intended to provide sufficient and clearly perceivable long-term price signals for available capacity. As integral part of the market, CMs interact with the other markets. Markets like day-ahead markets are used to trade energy. Imbalance markets or reserve requirements are examples for markets for flexibility. Among others, green certificates are in place to value emission-neutral injection from RES. Resulting altered prices and shifting remuneration have effects on all generation technologies. CMs may affect participating technologies by imposing a capacity demand. A resulting change in the generation mix may also have an impact on non-participating technologies. Two gaps can be identified in the discussion and modeling of CMs in the literature. First, proposed game-theoretic equilibrium models fall short in representing the distinctive features of different types of CMs. Second, most models incorporating CMs found in the literature only focus on the interaction with the energy-based market. Valid assessments of CM need to consider the interaction of remuneration for available capacity and flexibility, and the indirect interaction with the remuneration for emission-neutral RES. Two formulations of a game-theoretic market equilibrium model are proposed which represent specific CMs with its distinctive features, in particular a market-wide centralized capacity market (cCM) and targeted strategic reserves (SRs). Moreover, the equilibrium models explicitly combine the CMs with markets for flexibility and indirect with remuneration for RES. We contribute to the discussion of CMs by quantifying the interactions and shifting shares of remuneration. Based on the interaction between CMs and remuneration for emission-neutral injection, the effect of CMs on non-participating RES is described. We conclude based on the case study results that targeted mechanisms, like SRs, implemented with the single purpose of ensuring availability introduce large inefficiencies in the system by missing on the interaction between availability and flexibility. In contrast, a market-wide cCM provides a beneficial outcome for all technologies. At the same time, it yields a sufficient high reserve margin at lowest cost. It provides clear signals for the different values of energy-output, flexibility, availability and emission-neutral injection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity mechanism; Electricity market; Market adequacy; Nash equilibrium; System adequacy","Commerce; Costs; Game theory; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Available capacity; Equilibrium models; Generation technologies; Indirect interactions; Nash equilibria; Renewable energy source; Reserve requirements; System adequacy; Investments; alternative energy; electricity generation; energy market; game theory; renewable resource; technology","Aune, F.R., Dalen, H.M., Hagem, C., Implementing the EU renewable target through green certificate markets (2012) Energy Econ., 34, pp. 992-1000. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140988311001368; Batlle, C., Pérez-Arriaga, I., Zambrano-Barragán, P., Regulatory design for RES-E support mechanisms: learning curves, market structure, and burden-sharing (2012) Energy Policy, 41, pp. 212-220. , http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301421511008238; (2016), https://www.belpex.be/trading/product-specification/, Belpex, Belpex Day-Ahead Market (DAM) URL; Bezanson, J., Edelman, A., Karpinski, S., Shah, V.B., Julia: A Fresh Approach to Numerical Computing (2015), http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1607; Bhagwat, P.C., Richstein, J.C., Chappin, E.J., de Vries, L.J., The effectiveness of a strategic reserve in the presence of a high portfolio share of renewable energy sources (2016) Util.

In common overseas power markets, CCGT and GT claim certain market shares as peak load plants with the latter boasting a high utilization rate as reserve plants. In South Korea, however, there has been no introduction of GT in the market that opened in 2001 with no analysis cases of GT's economy as a peak load plant. The current power market of South Korea is run on the cost-based pool, which allows for no price spikes. Since the capacity payment criteria for compensations for missing money are set based on GT generators, the power market uses GT generators as marginal plants. The purposes of this study were to analyze the competitive edge of GT generators as peak load plants in the domestic power market of South Korea and identify the causes of GT's failure in market entry, thus assessing the adequacy of market signals in the domestic power market.

Using hourly wholesale market data from 2008 to 2014, we find that firms exercise substantial market power in the highest demand hours with limited excess production capacity. The degree of market power execution in all other hours is low. Market inefficiencies are larger in the high demand hours and elevate production costs by 6.7%–19% above the competitive benchmark, with an average of 13%. This reflects 2.1% of the average market price across all hours. A recent regulatory policy clarifies that certain types of unilateral market power execution is permitted in Alberta. We find evidence that suggests that strategic behaviour changed after this announcement. Market power execution increased. We illustrate that the observed earnings are often sufficient to promote investment in natural gas based technologies. The rents from market power execution can exceed the estimated capacity costs for certain generation technologies. However, we demonstrate that the energy market profits in the presence of no market power execution are generally insufficient to promote investment in new generation capacity.

After discussing the economic fundamentals of wind and photovoltaic investments, the paper introduces the concept of the ""Merit order effect of renewables"". According to this concept electricity prices on wholesale power markets become smaller in periods during which large volumes of wind and photovoltaic generation is available and squeeze out relative expensive gas-fired power generation. The merit order effect of renewables has a couple of consequences. Among others it challenges the profitability of conventional power generation. If such generation capacities are still necessary, at least during a transitory period, a capacity mechanism may be put in place that generates an additional stream of income to the operators of conventional power generators. Another consequence of growing intermittent power generation is the need for concepts and technologies that deal with excess generation. Among these concepts are virtual and physical power storage capacities. In the last parts of the paper models are presented that are able to analyze these concepts from an economic point of view. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences - SIF, 2017.",,,"Ehlers, N., (2011) Strommarktdesign Angesichts des Ausbaus Fluktuierender Stromerzeugung.

However, due to their long-term focus, these mechanisms are typically uncoupled from short-term electricity markets. We introduce a new CRM design, which involves shortterm clearing of a market for generation capacity in parallel with that of the wholesale electricity market. The proposed CRM allows for participation of capacity providers from both generation and demand side. Also, emerging technologies that were not able to participate in existing CRMs due to the longterm nature of those markets (e.g., storage) are able to participate in the proposed market for generation capacity. The proposed CRM is shown to satisfy the competitiveness, fairness and energy security principles defined by the European Commission. Finally, our analysis shows that the proposed CRM can ensure supply adequacy at a lower cost when compared to rival designs, by taking advantage of daily and seasonal variability in system demand. © 2017 IEEE.","Adequacy of supply; Capacity market; Capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM); Power system economics; RES integration","Commerce; Economics; Energy policy; Energy security; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Adequacy of supply; Capacity markets; Capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM); Electricity generation capacity; Emerging technologies; Power system economics; Renewable energy source; Wholesale electricity markets; Investments","(2014) Assessment of Electricity Generation Adequacy in European Countries, , Council of European Energy Regulators, Tech.

However, those models do not explicitly consider the impact on investment decisions, mix of technologies and wholesale market prices; of policy decisions but as an external passive input to the model. This paper reviews existing approaches to model policy decisions in such a context, and provides a theoretical modeling framework that explicitly considers the interaction of policymakers' decisions with the generation investment and operation, and customers' response in a liberalized power system. Such kind of model, based on bi-level optimization, contributes to the longterm assessment of some policy decisions in the electricity sector. © 2017 IEEE.","Modeling; Optimization; Policymaker; Power sector; State of the art","Commerce; Decision making; Models; Optimization; Power markets; Bi-level optimization; Electricity generation; Generation investment; Investment decisions; Policymaker; Power sector; State of the art; Theoretical modeling; Investments","Hope, E., Skjeret, F.A., State-of-the-art research: Optimal investment in market-based electric power systems (2008) SNF, , Working paper, Apr; Joskow, P., Incentive regulation in theory and practice: Electricity distribution and transmission networks (2014) National Bureau of Economic Research, , Inc, NBER Chapters; Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., (2013) Regulation of the Power Sector, , London: Springer London; Batlle, C., Rodilla, P., A critical assessment of the different approaches aimed to secure electricity generation supply (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (11), pp. 7169-7179. , Nov; Vázquez, C., Batlle, C., Rivier, M., Pérez-Arriaga, J.I., Regulated tariff design in a liberalized power system: The case of Spain (2006) IIT Working Paper IIT-06-0XX, Instituto de Investigación Tecnológica, Universidad Pontificia Comillas, , Madrid; Zinaman, O., Bazilian, M., Miller, M., The Evolving Role of the Power Sector Regulator: A Clean Energy Regulators Initiative Report, , http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/61570.pdf, Accessed: 10-May-2016; (2013) Network Tariff Structure for A Smart Energy System, , Eurelectric May; Cossent, R., Gómez, T., Frías, P., Towards a future with large penetration of distributed generation: Is the current regulation of electricity distribution ready Regulatory recommendations under a European perspective (2009) Energy Policy, 37 (3), pp. 1145-1155. , Mar; Cervilla, C., Villar, J., Campos, F.A., Bi-level optimization of electricity tariffs and PV distributed generation investments (2015) European Energy Market (EEM), 2015 12th International Conference on the, pp. 1-5; Faruqui, A., Harris, D., Hledik, R., Unlocking the 53 billion savings from smart meters in the EU: How increasing the adoption of dynamic tariffs could make or break the EU's smart grid investment (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (10), pp. 6222-6231. , Oct; Boßmann, T., Eser, E.J., Model-based assessment of demandresponse measures-A comprehensive literature review (2016) Renew.

Changing its structure to retail or wholesale market model is one of the ways in order to carry on the planning towards restructuring. The pool market model is recognized as a conceivable model. It is a safe option to be more competitive, and transparent electricity supply industry. Even though, the pool market model is amongst the most preferred electricity market model, there are issues on the benefit of the generators involved. Hence, this paper discusses the pricing issue in pool based market model. In the proposed model, the approach of minimum generation capacity payment, and base load demand sharing in the single auction power pool are introduced with the efficiency, and the electricity price offered by generators are taken into account. An economic analysis is performed to highlight the benefits of the proposed model compared with other pool based market model in term of generation revenue and demand payment. © 2016 IEEE.","Capacity payment; Efficiency; Electricity Supply Industry (ESI); Pool market","Costs; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Economics; Efficiency; Lakes; Power markets; Capacity payments; Competitive electricity markets; Competitive environment; Electricity market model; Electricity prices; Minimum generations; Pool markets; Wholesale markets; Commerce","Asokan, K., Ashok Kumar, R., Modeling of bidding strategies for power suppliers and large consumers in electricity market with risk analysis (2013) International Journal of Soft Computing and Engineering (JJSCE), 3 (2). , May; Zou, P., Chen, Q., Xia, Q., He, C., Kang, C., Incentive compatible pool-based electricity market design and implementation: A Bayesian mechanism design approach (2015) Applied Energy, 158, pp. 508-518; Hassan, M.Y., Abdullah, M.P., Arifm A, S., Hussin, F., Majid, M.S., Electricity market models in restructured electricity supply industry (2008) Power and Energy Conference, 2008.

Both capacity mechanisms improve the security of supply and reduce consumer costs. Our results indicate that interconnections do not affect the effectiveness of a capacity market, while a strategic reserve is affected negatively. The neighboring zone may free ride on the security of supply provided by the zone implementing a capacity mechanism. However, a capacity market causes crowding out of generators in the energy-only zone.

I develop a partial equilibrium model to compare effects of three polar capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRMs) based on the assumption that a CRM is indicated. A strategic reserve (SR) policy with administratively set capacity targets, a capacity market (CM) based on public procurement, and a decentralized reserve market with the obligation of generators to finance reserves in relation to their peak supply (RM). Substantial differences of policies arise across countries and regarding consumers and producers due to power plant structures. By 2023, we find the decentralized RM to induce least pronounced distributional effects and only modest welfare reductions, while SR and CM induce higher losses. In the longer term until 2033, welfare results differ less pronounced, although the RM is most friendly to consumers. A robust policy conclusion has to pay attention to further aspects concerning the environment and technological developments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity mechanism; Electricity market; Investment model","electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; fossil fuel; investment; modeling; power plant; renewable resource; Europe","ARE, Aktualizacja prognozy zapotrzebowania na paliwa i energie do roku 2030 (2011), http://www.mg.gov.pl; Bernstein, R., Madlener, R., Short- and long-run electricity demand elasticities at the subsectoral level: a cointegration analysis for German manu- facturing industries (2015) Energy Econ., 48, pp. 178-187; Beurskens, L., Hekkenberg, M., Renewable Energy Projections as Published in the National Renewable Energy Action Plans of the European Member States (2011), https://www.ecn.nl, ECN; Boiteux, M., Peak-load pricing (1960) J. Bus., 33 (2), pp. 157-179; Bowring, J., Capacity markets in PJM (2013) Econ.

Although both types of delays can be used for representing material delays, each one offers different results with pros and cons that need to be well considered. Therefore, this paper seeks to implement FODs and PLDs in a generic electricity market model in order to assess their effectiveness and adequacy in the closest representation of the reality. As a result, SD modelers shall see through this investigation the importance and implications of material delays in their models, but also they will be able to choose the appropriate material delays for their applications. In fact, the simulation results comparing both models markedly show that PLDs are a better approximation to model the delays of construction of new plants as well as the retirement of old plants. Accordingly, if FODs are solely used, the electricity market models not only always provide less electricity in one or various years, they also produce inaccurate values that can lead to a dangerous energy planning, mainly because they modify the dynamics of the entire system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Delays; Electricity markets; System dynamics","Commerce; Electric industry; Gas emissions; System theory; Appropriate materials; Delays; Electricity market model; Energy planning; Entire system; Pipeline delay; System Dynamics; Transport delay; Power markets","Sterman, J., Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World (2000), https://books.google.de/books?id=CCKCQgAACAAJ, McGraw-Hill Higher Education, Irwin/McGraw-Hill; Reducing carbon emissions in China: industrial structural upgrade based on system dynamics (2013) Energy Strategy Rev., 2 (2), pp. 199-204. , east Asian Energy System Management Challenges; Teufel, F., Miller, M., Genoese, M., Fichtner, W., Review of system dynamics models for electricity market simulations (2013) Work.

Although the EU is projected to reach this goal, its achievement of objectives under its Emissions Trading System (ETS) may be delayed by carbon leakage, which is defined as a situation in which the reduction in emissions in the ETS region is partially offset by an increase in carbon emissions in the non-ETS regions. We study the interaction between emissions and hydropower availability in order to estimate the magnitude of carbon leakage in the South-East Europe Regional Electricity Market (SEE-REM) via a bottom-up partial equilibrium framework. We find that 6.3% to 40.5% of the emissions reduction achieved in the ETS part of SEE-REM could be leaked to the non-ETS part depending on the price of allowances. Somewhat surprisingly, greater hydropower availability may increase emissions in the ETS part of SEE-REM. However, carbon leakage might be limited by demand response to higher electricity prices in the non-ETS area of SEE-REM. Such carbon leakage can affect both the competitiveness of producers in ETS member countries on the periphery of the ETS and the achievement of EU targets for CO2 emissions reduction. Meanwhile, higher non-ETS electricity prices imply that the current policy can have undesirable outcomes for consumers in non-ETS countries, while non-ETS producers would experience an increase in their profits due to higher power prices as well as exports. The presence of carbon leakage in SEE-REM suggests that current EU policy might become more effective when it is expanded to cover more countries in the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon leakage; CO2 emissions; Energy Community; EU ETS","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Electric power system interconnection; Emission control; Gas emissions; Hydroelectric power; International law; Power markets; Carbon leakage; Electricity prices; Emissions reduction; Emissions trading system; Energy Community; EU Emissions Trading Systems; Partial equilibrium; Regional electricity markets; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity supply; emission control; emissions trading; energy market; European Union; Europe","Bjørndal, E., Bjørndal, M., Gribkovskaia, V., Congestion management in the Nordic power market—nodal pricing versus zonal pricing (2013) SNF Report 15-12, , https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/165371/R15_12.pdf?sequence=1isAllowed=y, Institute for Research in Economics and Business Administration Bergen, Norway; Burtraw, D., Kahn, D., Palmer, K., CO2 allowance allocation in the regional greenhouse gas initiative and the effect on electricity investors (2006) Electr.

Various de-rating factors and/or penalties have been incorporated into such mechanisms in order to reward the unit based on the contribution they make to system security, which in turn depends on the unit's reliability. However, this reliability is known to the firm but not to the regulator. We adopt a mechanism design approach for capacity payments based on a declaration by the firm of their reliability. The mechanism scales payments and penalties according to this declared reliability such that the firm's profit-maximising strategy is to truthfully reveal its reliability. A stochastic mixed complementarity problem (MCP) is used to model the interactions between the firms, and we apply this methodology to a test system using Irish electricity market data. Truth-telling is induced, increasing the efficiency of capacity payments while eliminating the requirement for the regulator to allocate resources to discovering reliability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity payments; Mechanism design; Mixed complementarity problem; Reliability","Commerce; Machine design; Power markets; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Capacity payments; Fixed cost; Liberalised electricity market; Mechanism design; Mixed com-plementarity problems; System security; Test systems; Truth-telling; Reliability; complementarity; electricity supply; numerical model; resource allocation; stochasticity; Ireland","Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms and the Internal Market for Electricity (2013), http://www.acer.europa.eu/Official_documents/Acts_of_the_Agency/Publication/CRMs%20and%20the%20IEM%20Report%20130730.pdf, Available online:; Botterud, A., Doorman, G., Generation Investment and Capacity Adequacy in Electricity Markets (2008) International Association for Energy Economics Energy Forum second quarter 2008, , http://www.iaee.org/documents/newsletterarticles/208Botterud.pdf?origin=publication_detail, Available online:; Bowring, J., Capacity markets in PJM (2013) Econ.

For that purpose, we set up a two-stage framework in which two kinds of electricity generators, peak load and base load generators, choose their capacity investment levels first and then compete on the basis of bids in a centralized market to sell electricity to consumers. We use data from the Texas ERCOT to evaluate consumers' welfare. We find that the introduction of capacity payments has two countervailing effects. On the one hand, it increases the wholesale electricity price. On the other hand, it reduces price volatility and increases the reliability of the system. We find that capacity payments are more beneficial for consumers in a perfectly competitive market than in the presence of certain degree of market power. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity payments; Electricity market; Energy policy; Risk analysis; Welfare analysis","Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Energy policy; Power markets; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Capacity investment; Capacity payments; Compensation payments; Electricity generators; Liberalized electricity market; Welfare analysis; Welfare implications; Wholesale electricity; Investments; compensation system; electricity; energy market; energy policy; risk assessment; welfare economics; Texas; United States","Allcott, H., Rethinking real-time electricity pricing (2011) Resour.

Specifically, for short-term operations, flexibility here indicates that sufficient ramp capacity is available to respond to the varying load and intermittent generation. To address the growing needs for ramp capacity, markets for ramp products have been launched in practice such as those in California ISO and Midcontinent ISO. Sometimes, expensive fast-start units must be committed in real time to guarantee sufficient ramp capacity. Occasionally even worse, inadequate ramp capacity from the given generation portfolio might lead to curtailment of renewable generation or load shedding. Therefore, more supplies of ramp capacity are required. In fact, wind power producers (WPPs) are physically capable of offering ramp services, which gives us a potential option. In this paper, we attempt to explore the mechanism and economic impacts of including WPPs as ramp capacity providers. To conduct the analyses, a two-stage stochastic real-time unit commitment model considering ramp capacity adequacy is formulated. Case studies indicate that both the system and the WPPs can benefit in the proposed framework. © 2016 IEEE.","flexibility; ramp capacity; ramp product; real-time unit commitment; stochastic programming; Wind power","Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Wind power; flexibility; Generation flexibilities; Generation portfolios; ramp capacity; ramp product; Real time; Renewable generation; Short-term operation; Electric load shedding","Bushnell, J., Harvey, S.M., Stoft, S., Hobbs, B.F., (2011) Final Opinion on Payment for Provision of Flexible Ramping, , http://www.caiso.com/Documents/110825DecisiononFlexibleRampingConstraintCompensation-MSCOpinion.pdf, Market Surveillance Committee of the California ISO, Aug.

The optimization strategy aims to minimize the total cost of the traded energy over a whole day, taking into account the intertemporal constraints. The proposed formulation leads to the solution of different linear optimization problems, following the natural temporal sequence of electricity spot markets. Intertemporal constraints regarding time dependent resources are fulfilled through a scheduling process performed after the day-ahead market clearing. Each of the different problems is of moderate dimension and requires short computation times. The benefits of the proposed strategy are assessed comparing the payments done by an aggregator over a sample period of one year following different deterministic and probabilistic strategies. Results show that probabilistic strategy reports better benefits for aggregators participating in power markets. © 2017 by the authors.

In this regard, three thermal units including base, intermediate and peak load technologies with wind turbine generators have been considered. In the proposed framework, the uncertainty of the thermal units due to their outages as well as the uncertainty of wind power generation is well modeled. Simulations have been done in both with and without paying capacity payment to the investors. The generation capacity and system reliability are evaluated and analyzed using the proposed model. Numerical results illustrate the effective performance of the proposed model. © 2016 IEEE.","generation capacity investment; reliability; system dynamic; wind power","Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Turbogenerators; Wind power; Wind turbines; Capacity payments; Effective performance; Generation capacity; Numerical results; Renewable energy source; System Dynamics; System reliability; Thermal units; Investments","Dhungana, D., Karki, R., Data constrained adequacy assessment for wind resource planning (2015) IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 6 (1), pp. 219-227. , Jan; Dehghan, S., Amjady, N., Conejo, A.J., Reliability-constrained robust power system expansion planning (2016) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 31 (3), pp. 2383-2392. , May; Muñoz-Delgado, G., Contreras, J., Arroyo, J.M., Joint expansion planning of distributed generation and distribution networks (2015) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 30 (5), pp. 2579-2590. , Sept; Hajipour, E., Bozorg, M., Fotuhi-Firuzabad, M., Stochastic capacity expansion planning of remote microgrids with wind farms and energy storage (2015) IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 6 (2), pp. 491-498. , April; Samadi, M., Javidi, M.H., Ghazizadeh, M.S.J., Modeling the effects of demand response on generation expansion planning in restructured power systems (2013) Journal of Zhejiang University Science C, 14 (12), pp. 966-976. , December; Montoya-Bueno, S., Muoz, J.I., Contreras, J., A stochastic investment model for renewable generation in distribution systems (2015) IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy, 6 (4), pp. 1466-1474. , Oct; Botterud, A., Korpas, M., A stochastic dynamic model for optimal timing of investments in new generation capacity in restructured power systems (2007) International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, 29, pp. 163-174; Assili, M., Javidi, M.H., Ghazi, R., An improved mechanism for capacity payment based on system dynamics modeling for investment planning in competitive electricity environment (2008) Energy Policy, 36, pp. 3703-3713; Pereira, A., Saraiva, J.T., Generation expansion planning (GEP) A long-term approach using system dynamics and genetic algorithms (GAs) (2011) Energy, 36, pp. 5180-5199; Choi, D.G., Thomas, V.M., An electricity generation planning model incorporating demand response (2012) Energy Policy, 42, pp. 429-441; Alishahi, E., Parsa Moghaddam, M., Sheikh-El-Eslami, M.K., An investigation on the impacts of regulatory interventions on wind power expansion in generation planning (2011) Energy Policy, 39, pp. 4614-4623; Olsina, F., Garces, F., Haubrich, H.J., Modelling long term dynamics of electricity markets (2006) Energy Policy, 34, pp. 1411-1433; Koomey, J., Rosenfeid, A., Gadgil, A., Conservation screening curves to compare efficiency investments to power plants (1990) Energy Policy, 18, pp. 774-782; Bakirtzis, G.A., Biskas, P.N., Chatziathanasiou, V., Generation expansion planning by MILP considering mid-term scheduling decisions (2012) Electric Power Systems Research, 86, pp. 98-112; De Jonghe, C., Hobbs, B.F., Belmans, R., Optimal generation mix with short-term demand response and wind penetration (2012) IEEE Transaction on Power Systems, 27, pp. 830-839",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509049882,,,"English","Smart Grids Conf., SGC",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018449722

However, a growing number of EU Member States have implemented national Capacity Mechanisms in order to ensure future security of supply within their own borders, which may distort the cross-border trade of energy. This local view of energy security is in response to internal technical and economic constraints and a perceived inability of cross-border electricity flows to be a reliable source of capacity at times of maximum stress, in favour of self-sufficiency. A number of routes are available to resolve this conflict through permitting cross-border participation of generators in local Capacity Mechanisms, but this requires resolution of a number of complicating factors, not least a means for properly allocating transmission capacity without introducing further distortions to the energy market. Alternative solutions could be enacted at an EU-level, such as through the alignment of Capacity Mechanisms to a common model, or the introduction of an EU-wide single Capacity Mechanism, but the current regulatory focus appears to remain on resolution of such issues at a national level. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity markets; Electricity transmission; Energy security; Interconnection",,"Ang, B.W., Choong, W.L., Ng, T.S., Energy security: definitions: dimensions and indexes (2015) Renew.

Storage is different from the conventional generators that have traditionally balanced supply and demand on fast time scales due to its hard energy capacity constraints, dynamic coupling, and low marginal costs. These differences are leading system operators to propose new mechanisms for enabling storage to participate in reserve and real-time energy markets. The persistence of market power and gaming in electricity markets suggests that these changes will expose new vulnerabilities. We develop a new model of strategic behavior among storages in energy balancing markets. Our model is a two-stage game that generalizes a classic model of capacity followed by Bertrand–Edgeworth price competition by explicitly modeling storage dynamics and uncertainty in the pricing stage. By applying the model to balancing markets with storage, we are able to compare capacity and energy-based pricing schemes and to analyze the dynamic effects of the market horizon and energy losses due to leakage. Our first key finding is that capacity pricing leads to higher prices and higher capacity commitments, and that energy pricing leads to lower, randomized prices and lower capacity commitments. Second, we find that a longer market horizon and higher physical efficiencies lead to lower prices by inducing the storage to compete to have their states of charge cycled more frequently. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Electric power systems; Energy storage; Game theory; Regulation; Renewable energy","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Dynamics; Economics; Electric power systems; Energy dissipation; Energy storage; Game theory; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Uncertainty analysis; Capacity competition; Conventional generators; Price competition; Regulation; Renewable energies; Strategic Behavior; Supply and demand; Wind and solar power; Electric energy storage","Acemoglu, D., Bimpikis, K., Ozdaglar, A., Price and capacity competition (2009) Games Econ.

New power plants that are to be constructed should guarantee the highest level of security of electricity supply and be consistent with actual energy policy carried out by a country. Thus, the proposed remuneration system is based on an ‘operational reserve’ system which is currently implemented in Poland. The proposed system distinguishes new power generating assets according to a total assessment based on three factors: type of technology (including emission benchmark), flexibility, and location (addressing issue of brown or green field investment and conditions of power system operation). Existing power plants are also subsidized by the proposed mechanism, however their remuneration is not based on their characteristics. The details of the proposed mechanism, a cost analysis, and a standardized evaluation procedure are described in the paper. The concept itself is universal and can be intruded in every power system that must overcome capacity problem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity mechanism; Missing capacity; Missing money; Power reserves; Resource adequacy","Energy policy; Electricity supply; Missing capacity; Missing money; nocv1; Operational reserve; Power reserves; Power system operations; Remuneration systems; Resource adequacy; Investments; electricity supply; energy policy; energy use; power plant; Poland [Central Europe]","Ausubel, L.M., Cramton, P., Using forward markets to improve electricity market design, Util (2010) Policy, 18, pp. 195-200; Baldick, R., Helman, U., Hobbs, B.F.F., O'Neill, R.P.P., Design of Efficient Generation Markets (2005) Proc.

To analyse this situation, power markets are simulated over the long term with a System Dynamics model integrating new investment and closure decisions. This last trait is relevant to studying investment in power generation in mature markets undergoing policy shocks. The energy-only market design with a price cap, with and without a capacity mechanism, is compared to scarcity pricing in two investment behaviour scenarios with and without risk aversion. The results show that the three market designs lead to different levels of risk for peaking unit investment and results thus differ according to which risk aversion hypothesis is adopted. Assuming a risk-neutral investor, the results indicate that compared to an energy-only market with a price cap at 3 000 €/MWh, an energy-only market with scarcity pricing and the market design with a capacity mechanism are two efficient options to reach similar levels of load loss. But under the hypothesis of risk aversion, the results highlight the advantage of the capacity mechanism over scarcity pricing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity mechanism; Energy transition; Mature market; Security of supply; System dynamics","Commerce; Costs; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Power markets; Risk perception; System theory; Capacity adequacy; Energy transitions; Energy-only market; Mature markets; Risk aversion; Security of supply; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Investments; alternative energy; energy efficiency; energy market; investment; numerical model; power generation","Assili, M., Javidi, H., Ghazi, R., An improved mechanism for capacity payment based on system dynamics modeling for investment planning in competitive electricity environment (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (10), pp. 3703-3713; Babcock, B.A., Choi, E.K., Feinerman, E., Risk and probability premiums for CARA utility functions (1993) J.

Ubiquitous in real-world electricity markets, CRMs are introduced country by country in an ad hoc manner, lacking the theoretical legitimacy and the conceptual coherence enabling comparability and coordination. They are eyed with suspicion by a profession wedded to a theoretical benchmark model that argues that competitive energy-only markets with VOLL pricing provide adequate levels of capacity. While the benchmark model is a consistent starting point for discussions about electricity market design, it ignores the two market failures that make CRMs the practically appropriate and theoretically justified policy response to capacity issues. First, energy-only markets fail to internalize security-of-supply externalities as involuntary curbs on demand under scarcity pricing generate social costs beyond the private non-consumption of electricity. Second, when demand is inelastic and the potential capacity additions are discretely sized, investors face asymmetric incentives and will underinvest at the margin rather than overinvest. After presenting the key features of the theoretical benchmark model, this paper conceptualizes security of supply externalities and asymmetric investment incentives and concludes with some consideration regarding design of CRMs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Asymmetric investment incentives; Capacity remuneration mechanisms; Electricity markets; Investment; Security of supply externalities; VOLL pricing","Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Energy security; Power markets; Benchmark models; Deregulated electricity market; Electricity market design; Energy-only market; Investment incentives; Market failures; Potential capacity; Security of supply; Investments; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; energy use; investment incentive; price dynamics","Arrow, K.J., The organization of economic activity: issues pertinent to the choice of market versus nonmarket allocation, In: Haveman, R (1970), Margolis, J.

Capacity mechanism designs do not explicitly consider the effects of refurbishment of existing generation units in order to increase their reliability. This paper presents a stochastic mixed complementarity problem to examine the impact of refurbishment on electricity prices and generation investment. Capacity payments are found to increase reliability when refurbishment is not possible, while capacity payments and reliability options yield similar results when refurbishment is possible.

On the other hand, diverging national market designs pose a threat to the continuation of this process. Given the challenges to electricity market design in a multi-regional context, we analyze how different design aspects, namely cross-border congestion management and capacity mechanisms, affect welfare and generation adequacy in Europe. In doing so, we rely on an agent-based simulation model for electricity wholesale markets which we apply within several numerical, computational case studies for the region of Central Western Europe (2012–2030). Our results confirm the benefits of market coupling in terms of welfare as well as generation adequacy. Furthermore, we find indications that coordinating market designs across regions supports these targets. Therefore, we recommend that European energy policy forms a stable, transparent regulatory framework with cross-border market coupling as an integral component. In this context, energy policy targets should be clearly defined and operationalized, which also needs to consider potential conflicts between them. Finally, electricity market designs need to be coordinated among states to benefit most from a common European market. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modeling and simulation; Electricity market design; European electricity markets; Generation adequacy; Market coupling; Welfare analysis","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Electric industry; Energy policy; Power markets; Agent-based modeling and simulation; Electricity market design; Generation adequacy; Market coupling; Welfare analysis; Commerce; design method; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; modeling; Europe","Arango, S., Larsen, E.R., Cycles in deregulated electricity markets: Empirical evidence from two decades (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (5), pp. 2457-2466; Boffa, F., Pingali, V., Vannoni, D., Increasing market interconnection: An analysis of the Italian electricity spot market (2010) Int.

These incentives can be introduced in practice by means of two different (but non-conflicting) approaches in capacity mechanisms. First, performance incentives can be linked to constraints on tradable quantities (the so-called firm capacity or firm energy), which limit the amount of ""reliability"" that a given resource may sell in the mechanism, and which may be recalculated penalising potential unfulfilments. Second, they can be implemented as financial penalties for failure to comply with the commitments foreseen in the capacity contract. The first approach has been applied since the outset of capacity markets. The second did not receive much attention in the early stages of the implementation of adequacy mechanisms, but there is a growing trend on implementing it in modern designs. In this paper, after framing the problem conceptually, empirical evidence (particularly from Colombia, ISO New England, PJM, United Kingdom, and France) is compiled to reveal current trends in enhancing short-term performance in capacity mechanisms. © 2017 by the IAEE.","Capacity mechanisms; Explicit penalty; Performance incentives; Reliability product; System adequacy",,"Batlle, C., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., Design criteria for implementing a capacity mechanism in deregulated electricity markets (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 184-193; Batlle, C., Barroso, L.A., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., The changing role of the state in the expansion of electricity supply in Latin America (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (11), pp. 7152-7160; Batlle, C., Mastropietro, P., Rodilla, P., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., The system adequacy problem: Lessons learned from the American continent (2015) Capacity Mechanisms in the EU Energy Markets: Law, Policy, and Economics, , In: L.

There is a wide range of models under this new hybrid regime which essentially combine the energy market with planning and long-term risk transfer arrangements. This paper takes an institutionalist approach in terms of modularity of the market design, and reviews the issues with the standard historical market model which led to the introduction of additional long term “modules”. We then study the interactions between the existing and new “modules” and identify ways in which the initial market modules can be improved to address inconsistencies with the new modules. We conclude by discussing the conditions under which the various changes in market architectures could converge toward a hybrid regime structured around a “two step competition”, with a “competition for the market” via the auctioning of long-term contracts to support investment, followed by “competition in the market” for short term system optimisation via the energy market. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonisation policy; Electricity market; Long-term contracts; Low-carbon investment; Market design","Commerce; Decarbonization; Electric industry; Energy security; Power markets; Decarbonisation; Electricity sector; Long-term contracts; Low carbon; Market architectures; Market design; Security of supply; System optimisation; Investments; carbon; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy","Anaya, K., Pollittt, M., Understanding best practice regarding interruptible connections for wind generation: lessons from national and international experience (2013), EPRG Working Paper 1309.Cambridge University; Aoki, M., Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis (2001), MIT Press Boston; Baldwin, C., Clark, K., Design Rules: The Power of Modularity (2000), Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press Cambridge MA; Batlle, C., Barroso, L.A., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., The changing role of the state in the expansion of electricity supply in Latin America (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (11), pp. 7152-7160; Bohn, R.E., Golub, B.W., Tabors, R.D., Schweppe, F.C., Deregulating the generation of electricity through the creation of spot markets for bulk power (1984) Energy J., 5, p. 2; Boiteux, M., La tarification des demandes en pointe: Application de la théorie de la vente au coût marginal (1949), Revue Générale de I'Electricité, 58, pp. 321–340.

Most of the proposals for price computation existing in the literature are concerned with short-term competitive equilibrium (generators should not be willing to change the dispatch assigned to them by the auctioneer), which implies operational-cost recovery for all of the generators accepted in the auction. However, this is in general not enough to choose between the different pricing schemes. We propose to include an additional criterion in order to discriminate among different pricing schemes: prices have to be also signals for generation expansion. Using this condition, we arrive to a single solution to the problem of defining prices, where they are computed as the shadow prices of the balance equations in a linear version of the unit commitment problem. Importantly, not every linearization of the unit commitment is valid; we develop the conditions for this linear model to provide adequate investment signals. Compared to other proposals in the literature, our results provide a strong motivation for the pricing scheme and a simple method for price computation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity auctions; Integer decisions; Investment signals; Marginal cost; Side payments","Commerce; Depreciation; Investments; Signal analysis; Competitive equilibrium; Electricity auctions; Generation expansion; Integer decisions; Integer variables; Marginal costs; Side-payments; Unit commitment problem; Costs; auction; electricity; investment; price determination","Andrianesis, P., Liberopoulos, G., Kozanidis, G., Papalexopoulos, A.D., Recovery mechanisms in day-ahead electricity markets with non-convexities-Part I: design and evaluation methodology (2013) IEEE Trans.

Cruz de Marcenado 26, Madrid, Spain","The past two decades of growth in renewable energy sources of electricity (RES-E) have been largely driven by out-of-market support policies. These schemes were designed to drive deployment on the basis of specific subsidies sustained in time to allow for the larger costs as well as to limit investor risk. While these policies have proven to be effective, the way they have been designed to date has led to costly market distortions that are becoming more difficult to ignore as penetrations reach unpreceded levels. In the context of this growing concern, we provide a critical analysis of the design elements of RES-E support schemes, focusing on how they affect this trade-off between promoting and efficiently integrating RES-E. The emphasis is on the structure of the incentive payment, which in the end turns to be the cornerstone for an efficient integration. We conclude that, while needed, a well-designed and further developed capacity-based support mechanism complemented with ex-post compensations defined for reference benchmark plants, such as the mechanism currently implemented in Spain, is an alternative with good properties if the major goal is truly market integration. The approach is robust to future developments in technology cost, performance and market penetration of RES-E. © 2017","Electricity market design; Market integration; Negative prices; RES-E support schemes","Costs; Economic and social effects; Integration; Renewable energy resources; Compatible schemes; Electricity market design; Incentive payments; Market integration; Negative prices; Post compensations; Reference benchmarks; Renewable energy source; Investments; adult; electricity supply; energy market; energy policy; Spain","Barquin, J., The new Spanish electricity market design, ENERDAY 2014−In: Proceedings of the 9th Conference on Energy Economics and Technology - A European Energy Market?, Dresden, Germany, April 11th, 2014 (2014); Batlle, C., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., Zambrano-Barragán, P., Regulatory design for RES-E support mechanisms: learning curves, market structure, and burden-sharing (2012) Energy Policy, 41, pp. 212-220; Bird, L., Milligan, M., Lew, D., Integrating Variable Renewable Energy: Challenges and Solutions (2013), www.nrel.gov, National Renewable Energy Laboratory Golden, Colorado, USA (NREL/TP-6A20-60451).

Larsen et al. [1] propose a framework based on twelve dimensions to evaluate SoES for a single jurisdiction. However, actions aimed at improving one dimension might impact others negatively, adversely affecting the overall system. Understanding how these dimensions are interrelated is thus a prerequisite for appropriate planning and resource allocation. We apply a Cross Impact Analysis (CIA) to these dimensions to determine the degree to which the different dimensions depend on each other. From this we derive an influence diagram to visualise the interdependencies and a scatter plot to categorise the dimensions as independent, driver, connector or outcome. Actions targeting the drivers or connectors are potentially the more effective ones a regulator can take, as the consequences will gradually ripple through the system. Having an integral view of the dimensions' interdependencies provides a better understanding of the higher-order changes an intervention may cause. This enables policymakers and regulators to identifying where in the system to intervene to achieve the desired effect with the least amount of resources and with as few undesirable side-effects as possible. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-impact factor analysis; Electricity; Energy security; Security of supply","Electricity; Energy policy; Cross-impact analysis; Electricity supply; Influence diagram; Integral view; Liberalisation; Policy makers; Renewable energies; Security of supply; Energy security; electricity supply; energy planning; policy making; ripple; security","Larsen, E.R., Osorio, S., van Ackere, A., A framework to evaluate security of supply in the electricity sector (2017) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 79, pp. 646-655; Gosden, E., UK energy crisis deepens as SSE plans early plant closure (2016), http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/12139151/UK-energy-crisis-deepens-as-SSE-plans-early-plant-closure.html, The Telegraph; OFGEM, Electricity security of supply.

Comillas, Alberto Aguilera 25, Madrid, Spain","Incentives have played a major role in wind power development in Spain, having allowed the country to reach top worldwide positions in terms of wind power penetration but having also contributed to a structural cost-revenue unbalance. Feed-in tariff and premium schemes had been in force in Spain since the inception of wind power until the adoption of an auction-based support framework in 2016. So far, auctions have resulted in no incentives being allocated to any new wind farm. The present paper analyses the historical evolution of wind power support schemes in Spain and assesses the long run impact of the newly adopted policies on the future evolution of wind capacity and system costs through a behavioral stochastic System Dynamics model. Results show that the current lack of incentives will entail limited wind capacity growth, below the goal set in Spain's Renewable Energy Plan 2011–2020. Incentive levels required to meet specific goals in terms of capacity growth and system costs are computed and discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Auctions; Dynamic modeling; Energy planning; Incentives; Spain; Wind power","Commerce; Costs; Dynamic models; Energy policy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Auctions; Energy planning; Historical evolutions; Incentives; Spain; System dynamics model; Wind power development; Wind power penetration; Cost benefit analysis; alternative energy; assessment method; auction; energy planning; energy policy; energy resource; incentive; modeling; power generation; renewable resource; simulation; wind farm; wind power; Spain","The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (2001) Off J Eur Commun, 283, pp. 33-40; The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (2009) Off J Eur Commun, 140, pp. 16-62; Red Electrica de España, 2013.

However, most work focusses either more generally on energy security or on a single fuel. We develop a comprehensive but flexible framework to assess the SoES for a single jurisdiction, taking into the account the specificities of electricity. This framework has two aims: (i) provide a snapshot of the situation to understand current weaknesses and determine what actions are required; (ii) capture the evolution over time to evaluate progress and identify potential problems before they materialise. The framework, based on an extensive literature review, consists of twelve dimensions that are critical for SoES. We develop metrics that capture the state and evolution of each dimension. This framework is intended to be a management information tool for all stakeholders, aimed at organising data and structuring its analysis, to enable monitoring the evolution of the SoES, while also functioning as an early-warning system by flagging potential future problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity; Energy security; Framework; Security of supply","Electricity; Energy policy; Information management; Network function virtualization; Early Warning System; Electricity supply; Flexible framework; Framework; Literature reviews; Management information tools; Potential problems; Security of supply; Energy security","Pascual, C., Elkind, J., (2010) Energy Security: Economics, Politics, Strategies, and Implications, , Brookings Institution Press; Aune, F.R., Golombek, R., Kittelsen, S.A.C., Rosendahl, K.E., Liberalizing European energy markets: an economic analysis (2008), Edward Elgar Pub Cheltenham, UK; Northampton, Mass; Roggenkamp, M.M., Boisseleau, F., The regulation of power exchanges in Europe (2005), 1st ed.

Together with the transmission grid congestion caused by the remoteness of these sources from load centers, this creates a need for fast-adjusting conventional capacity such as gas-fired plants. However, these plants have become unprofitable because of lower power prices due to the zero marginal costs of renewables. Consequently, policymakers are proposing new measures for mitigating balancing costs and securing supply. In this paper, we take the perspective of the regulator to assess the effectiveness of support payments to flexible generators. Using data on the German power system, we implement a bi-level programming model, which shows that such payments for gas-fired plants in southern Germany reduce balancing costs and can be used as part of policy to integrate renewable energy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Balancing market; Congestion management; Day-ahead market; Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints; Renewable energy; Support payments","Commerce; Costs; Gas plants; Mathematical programming; Balancing market; Congestion management; Day ahead market; Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints; Renewable energies; Renewable energy resources; cost analysis; electricity supply; energy market; mathematical analysis; policy making; power generation; renewable resource; Germany","Baringo, L., Conejo, A., Wind power investment within a market environment (2011) Appl Energy, 88, pp. 3239-3247; Batlle, C., Rodilla, P., A critical assessment of the different approaches aimed to secure electricity generation supply (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 7169-7179; Batlle, C., Vázquez, C., Rivier, M., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., Enhancing power supply adequacy in Spain: migrating from capacity payments to reliability options (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (9), pp. 4545-4554; Benini, M., Cremonesi, F., Gallanti, M., Gelmini, A., Martini, R., Capacity payment schemes in the Italian electricity market (2006), CIGRE General Session; Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi), Ein Strommarkt für die Energiewende (2015), Ergebnispapier des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Energie (Weißbuch); Caldecott, B., McDaniels, J., Stranded generation assets: implications for European capacity mechanisms, energy markets and climate policy (2014), Working paper Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford; Deutsche Energie-Agentur, dena-Netzstudie II.

This is mainly due to the participation in these processes of various autonomous agents who does not always act in coordination. In response to this, the use of simulation approaches is useful to analyze the behavior and interaction of market participants. This paper is focused on conducting a state-of-the-art review about the implementation of System Dynamics (SD) approach to replicate the dynamic of long-term infrastructure investments in power systems. Regarding to this, it has been found that SD has been extensively used both to evaluate the expansion of generation capacity and the impact of investments in transmission network required to interconnect different electricity markets. However, it has not been found an application background of SD to assess the dynamic interaction among investments decisions in generation and transmission. In this context, the main contribution of the paper is to propose basic outlines to analyze the interaction of investments undertaken by agents of generation and transmission under a competitive electricity market by focusing on SD. Finally, this model seeks to be a tool to outline policies that encourage coordination and cooperation among autonomous power market agents. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Autonomous agents; Commerce; Decision making; Expansion; Power markets; System theory; Competitive electricity markets; Decision making process; Dynamic interaction; Generation capacity; Infrastructure investment; Market participants; Simulation approach; State-of-the art reviews; Investments","Ahmad, S., Tahar, R.M., Muhammad-Sukki, F., Munir, A.B., Rahim, R.A., Application of system dynamics approach in electricity sector modelling: A review (2016) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 56, pp. 29-37; Olsina, F., Garcés, F., Haubrich, H.-J., Modeling long-term dynamics of electricity markets (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (12), pp. 1411-1433; Weber, C., Das investitionsparadox in wett-bewerblichen strommärkten (2002) ET.

However, this monodisciplinary approach typically builds on homo oeconomicus assumptions and neglects consumers’ nonmonetary evaluations of SoS. This can result in short-sighted regulation, especially in the context of a transition like Germany's Energiewende. This paper provides a consumer-centered perspective on SoS employing psychological and sociological research on energy. German consumers’ strong involvement in the Energiewende and their strong commitment to it make them a fascinating case. To determine the practical implications, we explore under what circumstances altered levels of SoS could be acceptable to consumers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer behavior; Energy transition; Security of supply","consumption behavior; electricity supply; psychology; social behavior; Germany","AGEE-Stat, Installed Capacity of Solar and Wind Power in Germany (2014), http://www.erneuerbare-energien.de/EE/Redaktion/DE/Textbausteine/Banner/banner_photovoltaik.html, http://www.erneuerbare-energien.de/EE/Redaktion/DE/Textbausteine/Banner/banner_windkraft.html, Retrieved from (accessed 06.23.16.); (accessed 06.23.16.); Ajodhia, V.S., Regulating beyond Price.

We examine the theoretical and empirical conditions under which forward markets promote competition in the spot and retail markets. We also investigate the impact of market concentration on the new capacity payment mechanism. In order to ensure a competitive outcome for consumers, the regulatory authorities should promote competition in the forward market; moreover, the regulator should extend regulation to the price and quantity that the dominant firm bids for holding new reliability options. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity payments; Competition; European electricity market; Forward electricity markets","competition (economics); electricity supply; empirical analysis; theoretical study; Ireland","ACER, Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms and the Internal Market for Electricity (2013), http://www.acer.europa.eu, Available online from:; Allaz, B., Vila, J.L., Cournot competition, forward markets and efficiency (1993) J. Econ.

One of these mechanisms is a strategic reserve that retains generation capacity for use in times of critical supply shortage. We argue that strategic reserves have specific advantages compared to other capacity mechanisms in the context of the European energy transition. To date, however, the debate on capacity mechanisms has largely been restricted to national contexts. Against this background, we discuss the feasibility and potential benefits of coordinated cross-border strategic reserves to safeguard electricity supply and aid the energy transition in Germany and neighboring countries at large. Setting aside strategic reserve capacity which is deployed only in the event of extreme supply shortages could improve the security of electricity supply without distorting the EU's internal electricity market. In addition, overall costs may decrease when reserve procurement and activation are coordinated among countries, particularly if combined with flow-based market coupling. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity mechanisms; Energy transition; Strategic reserve","electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; energy planning; energy policy; European Union; strategic approach; Europe; Germany","ACER, Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms and the Internal Market for Electricity (2013), Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators 30 July; BDEW, Ausgestaltung eines dezentralen Leistungsmarkts (2013), Positionspapier des Bundesverbands der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V., Berlin; Beyer, J., Pfadabhängigkeit: Über institutionelle Kontinuität, anfällige Stabiliät und fundamentalen Wandel (2006), Frankfurt/New York; BMU, BDEW, BEE, Märkte stärken, Versorgung sichern.

The proposed mechanism guarantees differentiated remuneration depending on the technologies' contribution to the power system. It rewards higher the technologies that are more flexible, ecological and have more valuable location. The suggested change has a potential to solve missing money as well as missing capacity problem without distorting competition on the energy market. The mechanism is subjected to simulations with three randomly chosen technologies to prove its effectiveness. © 2016 IEEE.","Capacity mechanism; power system economics; power system reliability","Commerce; Capacity problems; Energy markets; Energy mix; Novel concept; Power system economics; Power system reliability; Power markets","Cepeda, M., Finon, D., How to correct for long-term externalities of large-scale wind power development by a capacity mechanism?

It was mainly a transition from a state-led model to a free-market one. Although some levels of progress is observable; security of supply, particularly in times of short term supply disruption had not been widely tested. Harsh winter conditions set a litmus test for Turkish energy markets. Basing on the this test, this paper provides an analysis of to what extent Turkey is open to the risks of energy supply security; and discusses possible measures to relieve future supply disruption risks. Energy policy-making should consider the fact that electricity and gas markets are highly intertwined in Turkey; and security of supply measures could have cross-market implications, paper concludes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

When introducing a capacity mechanism, therefore, regulators must ensure that the resulting mix will actually provide the firmness pursued, in such a way that both the generation and the demand resources awarded with the capacity remuneration actually perform as expected when the system needs them. In order to achieve this goal, some experts stressed the importance of including performance incentives in the CRM design. However, first capacity mechanisms (implemented mainly in the American continent) did not pay enough attention to this aspect. Two decades of operation have evidenced the need for performance incentives and these instruments are, at this writing, at the centre of the regulatory discussion.On the basis of a model analysis, this article demonstrates how the introduction of properly designed explicit penalty schemes for under-delivery can positively impact the CRM outcomes, providing resources with effective incentives to maximise their reliability, discriminating against non-firm generation units, and therefore increasing the effectiveness of the mechanism in achieving its objectives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity remuneration mechanisms; Explicit penalty; Long-term auction; Reliability option contracts; Security of supply; System adequacy","Energy resources; Technology; Explicit penalty; Long-term auction; Option contracts; Security of supply; System adequacy; Reliability analysis; design method; model validation; performance assessment; reliability analysis; theoretical study","Neuhoff, K., De Vries, L., Insufficient incentives for investment in electricity generations (2004) Utilities Policy, 12 (4), pp. 253-267; Joskow, P.L., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: need and design (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 159-170; Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., Stoft, S., Capacity market fundamentals (2013) Econ Energy Environ Policy, 2 (2), pp. 27-46; Henriot, A., Glachant, J.M., Capacity remuneration mechanisms in the European market: now but how?

In particular, current energy markets can exhibit a phenomenon of investment cycles, which generate phases of under and over-capacity, and hence additional costs and risks for generation adequacy. To cope with these issues, new mechanisms, called capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRM), have been (or will be) implemented. This paper assesses the dynamic effects of two CRMs, the capacity market and the strategic reserve mechanism, and studies to what extent they can reduce the investment cycles. Generation costs and shortage costs of both mechanisms are also compared to conclude on their effectivity and economic efficiency. A simulation model, based on system dynamics, is developed to study the functioning of both CRMs and the related investment decisions. The results highlight the benefits of deploying CRMs to solve the adequacy issue: shortages are strongly reduced compared to an energy-only market. Besides, the capacity market appears to be more beneficial, since it experiences fewer shortages and generation costs are lower. These comparisons can be used by policy makers (in particular in Europe, where these two CRMs are mainly debated) to determine which CRM to adopt. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity remuneration mechanism; Electricity market; Generation investment; System dynamics","Commerce; Costs; Deregulation; Dynamics; Electric power generation; Power markets; System theory; Capacity investment; Economic efficiency; Electricity generation; Energy-only market; Generation adequacy; Generation investment; Investment decisions; System Dynamics; Investments; assessment method; efficiency measurement; electricity generation; energy market; investment; strategic approach","Arango, S., Larsen, E., Cycles in deregulated electricity markets: empirical evidence from two decades (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (5), pp. 2457-2466; Assili, M., Javidi, D.H.M., Ghazi, R., An improved mechanism for capacity payment based on system dynamics modeling for investment planning in competitive electricity environment (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (10), pp. 3703-3713; Batlle, C., Rodilla, P., A critical assessment of the different approaches aimed to secure electricity generation supply (2010) Energy Policy, 38 (11), pp. 7169-7179; Bidwell, M., Henney, A., Will the new electricity trading arrangements ensure generation adequacy?

Likewise, the issues of its planning and management have grown complex. To address complexity in decision making, researchers have chosen system dynamics (SD) modelling and simulation technique. A state-of-art of such studies published during the period 2000-2013 is presented in this paper. The contribution of this review lies in categorizing the literature based on the important and contemporary researched areas. These research areas include models developed for policy assessment, generation capacity expansion, financial instruments, demand side management, mixing methods, and finally micro-worlds. Review shows that policy assessment and generation capacity expansion are the two most modelled topics. Financial instruments models evaluate different mechanism to support renewable technologies whereas mixing-methods channelize descriptive approach of SD into evaluating a single objective. Demand side management and micro-worlds are the least focused categories in SD. This paper also discusses the individual models in each category highlighting their construct, outcomes and any deficiencies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, conventional generation is still needed to ensure security of electricity supply. Therefore, capacity markets are currently being widely discussed as a measure to ensure generation adequacy in markets such as France, Germany, and the United States (e.g., Texas), or even implemented for example in Great Britain. We develop a dynamic capacity investment model to assess the effect of different capacity market design options in three scenarios: (1) no capacity market, (2) a capacity market for new capacity only, and (3) a capacity market for new and existing capacity. We compare the results along the three key dimensions of electricity policy - affordability, reliability, and sustainability. In a Great Britain case study we find that a capacity market increases generation adequacy. Furthermore, our results show that a capacity market can lower the total bill of generation because it can reduce lost load and the potential to exercise market power. Additionally, we find that a capacity market for new capacity only is cheaper than a capacity market for new and existing capacity because it remunerates fewer generators in the first years after its introduction. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity market; Capacity mechanism; Conventional electricity generation investment; Dynamic capacity investment model; Generation adequacy; Renewable energy sources","Commerce; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Capacity markets; Dynamic capacity; Electricity generation; Generation adequacy; Renewable energy source; Investments","Acer, Capacity remuneration on mechanisms and the internal market for electricity (2013) Regulation (EC), , 713/2009; Anderson, E., Cau, T., Implicit collusion and individual market power in electricity markets (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 211 (2), pp. 403-414; Baldick, R., Helman, U., Hobbs, B.F., O'Neill, R.P., Design of efficient generation markets (2005) Proceedings of the IEEE, 93 (11), pp. 1998-2012; (2012) Germany Threatened by Energy Overcapacity, , http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-07/germany-threatened-by-energy-overcapacity-ft-deutschland-says.html, Bloomberg Accessed 13.03.14; Bloomberg (2013) Europe Gas Carnage Shown by EON Closing 3-Year-Old Plant, , http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-12/europe-gas-carnage-shown-by-eon-closing-3-year-old-plant-energy.html, Accessed 16.04.13; Bloomberg (2013) Power Plant Capacity Payments Inevitable in Germany, , http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-23/power-plant-capacity-payments-inevitable-in-germany-ubs-says.html, UBS Says.

Long-term generation investment (LTGI) models are often used by policymakers to provide future projections given different input configurations. To understand both uncertainty around these projections and the ways they relate to the real-world, LTGI models can be calibrated and then used to make predictions or perform a sensitivity analysis (SA). However, LTGI models are generally computationally intensive and so only a limited number of simulations can be carried out. This paper demonstrates that the techniques of Bayesian emulation can be applied to efficiently perform calibration, prediction and SA for such complex LTGI models. A case study relating to GB power system generation planning is presented. Calibration reduces the uncertainty over a subset of model inputs and estimates the discrepancy between the model and the real power system. A plausible range of future projections that is consistent with the available knowledge (both historical observations and expert knowledge) can be predicted. The most important uncertain inputs are identified through a comprehensive SA. The results show that the use of calibration and SA approaches enables better decision making for both investors and policymakers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bayesian emulation; Calibration; Generation investments; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis",,"Joskow, P.L., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2008) Util.

The EU member states have therefore declared to strongly increase the share of renewable energy sources (RES-E) in the next decades. Given a large deployment of wind and solar capacities, there are two major impacts on electricity systems: First, the electricity system must be flexible enough to cope with the volatile RES-E generation, i.e., ramp up supply or ramp down demand on short notice. Second, sufficient back-up capacities are needed during times with low feed-in from wind and solar capacities. This paper analyzes whether there is a need for additional incentive mechanisms for flexibility in electricity markets with a high share of renewables. For this purpose, we simulate the development of the European electricity markets up to the year 2050 using a linear investment and dispatch optimization model. Flexibility requirements are implemented in the model via ramping constraints and provision of balancing power. We found that an increase in fluctuating renewables has a tremendous impact on the volatility of the residual load and consequently on the flexibility requirements. However, any market design that incentivizes investments in least (total system) cost generation investment does not need additional incentives for flexibility. The main trigger for investing in flexible resources is the achievable full load hours and the need for backup capacity. In a competitive market, the cost-efficient technologies that are most likely to be installed, i.e., gas-fired power plants or flexible CCS plants, provide flexibility as a by-product. Under the condition of system adequacy, flexibility never poses a challenge in a cost-minimal capacity mix. Therefore, any market design incentivizing investments in efficient generation thus provides flexibility as an inevi complement. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Electricity; Flexibility; Market design; Power plant fleet optimization; Renewable energy","Commerce; Costs; Electricity; Fleet operations; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Flexibility; Gas-fired power plants; Generation investment; Incentive mechanism; Market design; Optimization modeling; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Investments; alternative energy; electricity industry; energy market; European Union; investment incentive; optimization; power plant; renewable resource; solar power; wind power; Europe","Capros, P., Mantzos, L., Tasios, N., DeVita, A., Kouvaritakis, N., Energy trends to 2030 - update 2009 (2010) Tech.

The EU assumes the energy-only Target Electricity Model will deliver reliability but the UK argues that a capacity remuneration mechanism is needed. This paper argues that capacity auctions tend to over-procure capacity, exacerbating the missing money problem they were designed to address. The bias is further exacerbated by failing to address some of the missing market problems also neglected in the debate.

We undertake this in the context of the British market. We show how, ceteris paribus, the progressive replacement of coal with wind imposes extra costs of reserve and evaluate alternative way to meet this, whether through capacity payments funded by customers, or a reliability requirement on wind generators with capital cost or energy feed-in subsidies. We consider the reality of market concentration and the extent to which pragmatic regulation could allow prices to rise above marginal cost to reduce the extent of direct sub-sidies and complex market designs. We also evaluate the implied cost of carbon reduction in a pro-gressive replacement of coal with wind, when the security is maintained by extra peaking gas. We find that support through capital allowances rather than the energy market is more efficient. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Capital grants; Green certificates; Offshore wind; Renewable energy; Resource adequacy","Commerce; Power markets; Proven reserves; Capital grants; Green certificates; Offshore winds; Renewable energies; Resource adequacy; Costs; alternative energy; certification; energy market; energy policy; renewable resource; wind power; United Kingdom","Electrcity balancing significant code review (2013) Ofgem., , https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/ofgem-publications/82296/baringa-ebscr-quantitative-analysis.pdf; An electricity market for germany's energy transition (2014) Federal ministry for economic affairs and energy., , http://www.bmwi.de/EN/Service/publications,did=673330.html; Bower, J., Bunn, D.W., A model-based comparison of pool and bilateral market mechanisms for electricity trading (2000) Energy J., 23 (1), pp. 1-29; Bunn, D.W., Yusupov, T., The progressive inefficiency of replacing renewable obligation certificates with contracts-for-differences in the UK electricity market (2015) Energy policy., 82, pp. 298-309. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.002; Renewable energy review (2011) The climate change committee.; The contribution of parental and grandparental childhood social disadvantage to circulatory disease diagnosis in young Swedish men (2011) The impacts of policy on the financing of renewable projects: A case study analysis., , http://climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/the-impacts-of-policy-on-the-financing-of-renewable-projects-a-case-study-analysis, San Francisco, CA; Electricity market reform (EMR) white paper (2011) Department of Energy and Climate Change., , http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/white_papers/emr_wp_2011/emr_wp_2011.aspx; Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.

Low variable cost renewables increasingly make investments in gas-fired generation unprofitable. At the same time, growing feed-in from intermittent RETs amplifies fluctuations in power generation, thus entailing the need for flexible buffer capacity-currently mostly gas-fired power plants. A real options approach is applied to evaluate investment decisions and timing of a single investor in gas-fired power generation. We investigate the necessity and effectiveness of capacity payments. Our model incorporates multiple uncertainties and assesses the effect of capacity payments under different degrees of RET penetration. In a numerical study, we implement stochastic processes for peak-load electricity prices and natural gas prices. We find that capacity payments are an effective measure to promote new gas-fired generation projects. Especially in times of high renewable feed-in, capacity payments are required to incentivize peak-load investments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity market; Capacity mechanism; Investment incentives; Peak-load electricity generation; Real options; Renewable energy","Costs; Gas plants; Gases; Natural gas; Random processes; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Capacity markets; Electricity generation; Investment incentives; Real Options; Renewable energies; Investments","Abbott, M., Is the security of electricity supply a public good?

Most liberalized electricity markets have a poor track record at encouraging the deployment of smart meters and the development of demand response. In Europe, different models are considered for demand response, from a development under a regulated regime to a development under competitive perspectives. In this paper focusing on demand response and smart metering for mid-size and small consumers, we investigate which types of market signals should be sent to demand managers to see demand response emerge as a competitive activity. Using data from the French power system over nine years, we compare the possible market design options which would enable the development of demand response. Our simulations demonstrate that under the current market rules demand response is not a profitable activity in the French electricity industry. Introducing a capacity market could bring additional revenues to demand response providers and improve incentives to put in place demand response programs in a market environment. © 2015 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland","Capacity market; Demand response; Market design",,"ACER, 2013.

System security is viewed here as a multidimensional systemic property of the entire energy system. The paper shows that the different dimensions of a secure energy system are correlated, and hence their behaviour cannot be explained solely by an understanding of the individual dimensions or by system elements in isolation. The implication of this is that a proper assessment of the security of a power system requires a combination of different techno-economic models. The paper develops a comprehensive multi-model approach for investigating energy security issues within power systems, and applies it to a case study focussing on the Italian power sector. The core research activity involves using an energy systems model of Italy (MONET) to build a dedicated power systems model (PLEXOS-IT) and then undertaking a soft-linking exercise between the two models. The purpose is to use PLEXOS-IT to investigate the system adequacy of the power system results produced by MONET for future possible energy system scenarios. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a game-theoretic approach, the countries' policy options for capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRMs) are analysed with respect to welfare and distribution effects. An SR tends to narrow down the market, while ROs intensify price competition. However, cross-border effects are most likely negative for consumers and producers in total in the case of a unilateral implementation of a CRM, and market design changes should be coordinated. All results are strongly driven by possible changes in competition and market power. In practice, the market design decision should also consider possible regulatory failures that might lead to further market distortions. The risk of market design flaws seems larger for full capacity markets such as ROs than for an SR, which requires only minor adjustments to the market design. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Capacity mechanisms; Generation adequacy; Internal European Market; Market design","Commerce; Competition; Design; Game theory; Capacity markets; Distribution effect; European markets; Game-theoretic; Generation adequacy; Market design; Price competition; Simulation model; Power markets; competition (economics); cross-border relations; energy market; energy policy; numerical model; price determination; strategic approach; Europe","Capacity remuneration mechanisms and the internal market for electricity (2013) The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators Report, , (July 30); Strengthening Markets, Securing Supply.

The model is based on System Dynamics programming and simulates both new investments in electricity generation or demand-response and decommissioning decisions over several decades. The addition of a capacity mechanism under the form of capacity obligation is compared to the energy-only design with or without price cap. Two macro-economic scenarios are computed to study the effects of implementing a capacity obligation. The results underline that loss of load expectation is reduced with the addition of a capacity obligation compared to the energy-only case with a price cap. This is achieved through an increase in investments in peaking units including demand-response. Moreover, an efficiency ratio shows that a capacity obligation is more efficient to address capacity adequacy than the energy-only market with scarcity pricing. © 2015 IEEE.","Capacity mechanism; electricity generation investments; security of electricity supply; System Dynamics","Commerce; Costs; Economics; Electric power generation; Loss of load probability; Power markets; System theory; Capacity adequacy; Demand response; Efficiency ratio; Electricity generation; Electricity supply; Energy-only market; Loss of load expectation; System Dynamics; Investments","Joskow, P.L., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 159-170. , Sep; De Vries, L., Heijnen, P., The impact of electricity market design upon investment under uncertainty: The effectiveness of capacity mechanisms (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 215-227. , Sep; Cepeda, I.M., Finon, D., Generation capacity adequacy in interdependent electricity markets (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (6), pp. 3128-3143. , Jun; Cepeda, I.M., Saguan, M., Assessing long term effects of demand response policies in wholesale electricity markets (2014) CEEM Working Paper, No. 2014-6, , Paris-Dauphine University, May; Petitet, M., Finon, D., Janssen, T., Carbon price instead of support schemes: Wind power investments by the energy market (2014) CEEM Working Paper, No. 2014-09, , Paris-Dauphine University, Oct; RTE, (2014) French Capacity Market, Report Accompanying the Draft Rules, , http://www.rte-france.com/uploads/Mediatheque_docs/vie_systeme/annuelles/Mecanisme_capacite/2014_04_09_French_Capacity_Market.pdf, Apr; (2008) Synthèse Publique de l'Étude des Coûts de Référence, , DGEC Documents: Paris; (2010) Projected Costs of Generating Electricity: 2010 Edition, , OECD/IEA; (2013) Etude des Avantages Que l'Effacement Procure À la Collectivité et de Leur Intégration dans un Dispositif de Prime, , Jun; Green, R., Investment and generation capacity (2006) Competitive Electricity Markets and Sustainability, p. 21. , Edward Elgar Publishing., F.

Insufficient remuneration of conventional generators in an energy-only market may lead to inadequate generation mixes to cover peak demands and balance intermittent RES injection. Various corrective actions to the market designs are discussed, amongst them capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRMs). In this paper, a model is applied to compare the outcome of an energy-only market, strategic reserves and a capacity market. The comparison is done based on total cost paid to the electricity generators, installed capacities and occuring load shedding. The total costs are split up into energy-based payments (€/MWh), subsidies for RES and capacity-based payments (€/MW). The results show that origin of remuneration change with the chosen market design and lead to different generation mixes. Total cost increase with a CRM. However, taking into account load shedding, the increase of cost must be weighted with indirect costs of energy non-served. © 2015 IEEE.","Capacity remuneration mechanism; Energy Transition; Market Design; Mixed complementarity problem","Carbon; Commerce; Costs; Design; Electric power plant loads; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Conventional generators; Corrective actions; Electricity generators; Energy transitions; Installed capacity; Market design; Mixed com-plementarity problems; Renewable energy source; Electric load shedding","(2011) A Roadmap for Moving to A Competitive Low Carbon Economy in 2050, , Communication, Mar; Haas, R., Panzer, C., Resch, G., Ragwitz, M., Reece, G., Held, A., A historical review of promotion strategies for electricity from renewable energy sources in EU countries (2011) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 15 (2), pp. 1003-1034. , Feb; (2014) Renewable Energy and Security of Supply: Finding Market Solutions, , Report, Oct; Sensfuß, F., Ragwitz, M., Genoese, M., The merit-order effect: A detailed analysis of the price effect of renewable electricity generation on spot market prices in Germany (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (8), pp. 3086-3094. , Aug; Cepeda, M., Finon, D., How to correct for long-term externalities of large-scale wind power development by a capacity mechanism?

Among the suggested new measurements is a strategic reserve that will be used in situations of peak demand when in the spot market clearing cannot be achieved. The size of this strategic reserve is expected to be around 5 GW, approximately 5% of the current peak load. In this paper, for the first time a detailed agent-based simulation model is used to analyze the effects of the implementation of a strategic reserve on electricity prices and investments. The results show that this instrument considerably improves the security of supply and its yearly costs range from 50 to 300 million Euros depending on market scarcity.

The proposed model simulates the generation investment decisions taken by a particular agent (i.e. a generating company) in a market environment taking into account its competitors’ strategic investment. The investment decision of a particular company is modeled taking into account that such company has imperfect foresight on the future system development hence electricity prices. The delay in the construction of new plants is also explicitly modeled, in order to compute accurately the yearly revenues of each agent. On top of a conventional energy market, several capacity incentive mechanisms including capacity payment and capacity market are simulated, so as to assess their impact on the investment promotion for generation expansion. Results provide insight on the investment cycles as well as dynamic system behavior of long-term generation expansion planning in a competitive electricity industry. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","Agent-based modeling;

However, little progress has been made in the last decades in most regions - with some successful exceptions such as the Nordpool - and more research is needed to determine under which circumstances those benefits are achievable. We develop a system dynamics model to analyze the potential benefits and risks of market coupling, and to improve the understanding of its implications on policy design. This model allows us to simulate the long term behavior of two interconnected countries under different interconnection scenarios and different policies regarding capacity payments. The analysis is focused on Colombia and Ecuador, which have been trading electricity for more than 10 years and offer an interesting case study given their complementarity in terms of hydropower supply. However, the results of the simulations show that this complementarity is not necessarily exploited. While the relative size of the countries determines the magnitude of the potential benefits of integration, the interconnector capacity plays a key role in achieving those benefits. Additionally, both factors significantly affect the outcome of policies such as the implementation of capacity payments. We conclude that capacity policies and integration policies need to be coordinated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the introduction of the policy in 2009 electricity demand has declined continuously. In this article, we analyse how Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) has responded to falling demand and significant additional installed capacity as a result of climate change-related policies. We conclude that an energy-only market design, barriers to exit for incumbent plants, and time inconsistency of policy has resulted in investment in new renewable energy projects becoming largely intractable. In our opinion, changing the RET fixed GWh target will not alter this fact. To overcome barriers to exit, we examine three options for complementary public policy in the short-term: direct government intervention; a market-based solution; or regulation. In the long-term, a redesign of the energy-only NEM market seems inevitable. © 2015 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.","Barriers to exit; Energy-only markets; Renewable energy",,"(2014) 2014 Planning and Forecasting Scenarios, , Australian Energy Market Operator: AEMO, AEMO Publication, Melbourne; Berrie, T., The economics of system planning in bulk electricity supply (1967) Electr.

State governments progressively exited the merchant market by privatising their retailers and generators but the combination of an energy-only market design and the exit of government from the merchant market introduced an entirely new risk-the presence of investment-grade credit. Investment-grade credit is an essential precondition for meeting physical and systemic energy market security objectives and maximising welfare. In this article we model a Pure Play Retailer, a Pure Play Generator, and a Vertically Integrated Firm ('Gen-tailer') in Australia's energy-only electricity market using market data over a 10 year period to 2013/14. We find Pure Play businesses are unable to sustain investment-grade credit metrics whereas the Vertical Firm does in all years, despite the wild commodity price cycle contained within our data set. The starting premise of industrial organisation is that vertical arrangements are an organisational form of last resort.

Even at a national level, designing policies for electricity markets is an extremely complex task; but this is exacerbated in the case of market coupling, since different policies may be applied at the two ends of an interconnector. Furthermore, investors will make decisions based on their profitability, which depends among other things on the possibility of importing (exporting) from (to) neighboring countries, and will not necessarily coincide with the aims of the regulators or the consumers. We use simulation to analyze different scenarios of interconnection and capacity payments in two case studies: Colombia - Ecuador and Great Britain - France. These two cases exhibit important differences in terms of resources and complementarity between the countries, which lead to quite different outcomes for the same policies. The simulation results show that the potential benefits of market coupling are strongly related to complementarity. However, identifying the policies that should be implemented in order to achieve those benefits is far from obvious. In particular, large generation investment requirements and significant storage capacity in the region may lead to counterintuitive outcomes for certain policies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity adequacy; Capacity payments; Electricity market coupling; Policy; Simulation","Investments; Public policy; Affordable prices; Capacity adequacy; Capacity payments; Electricity market; Generation investment; Potential benefits; Security of supply; Simulation; Commerce; consumption behavior; decision analysis; design; energy market; profitability; simulation; Colombia; Ecuador; United Kingdom","Neuhoff, K., Hobbs, B.F., Newbery, D., (2011) Congestion management in European power networks, criteria to assess the available options; Stoft, S., Problems of transmission investment in a deregulated power market (2006) Compet Electr Mark Sustainability, , Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, F.

The impact of increasing wind power capacity on the optimal generation mix and generator profitability is analyzed for a test case that approximates the electricity market in Texas (ERCOT). We analyze three market policies that may support resource adequacy: Operating Reserve Demand Curves (ORDC), Fixed Reserve Scarcity Prices (FRSP) and fixed capacity payments (CP). Optimal expansion plans are comparable between the ORDC and FRSP implementations, while capacity payments may result in additional new capacity. The FRSP policy leads to frequent reserves scarcity events and corresponding price spikes, while the ORDC implementation results in more continuous energy prices. Average energy prices decrease with increasing wind penetration under all policies, as do revenues for baseload and wind generators. Intermediate and peak load plants benefit from higher reserve prices and are less exposed to reduced energy prices. All else equal, an ORDC approach may be preferred to FRSP as it results in similar expansion and revenues with less extreme energy prices.

The proposed model simulates the generation investment decisions taken by a particular agent (i.e. a generating company) in a market environment taking into account its competitors’ strategic investment. The investment decision of a particular company is modeled taking into account that such company has imperfect foresight on the future system development hence electricity prices. The delay in the construction of new plants is also explicitly modeled, in order to compute accurately the yearly revenues of each agent. On top of a conventional energy market, several capacity incentive mechanisms including capacity payment and capacity market are simulated, so as to assess their impact on the investment promotion for generation expansion. Results provide insight on the investment cycles as well as dynamic system behavior of long-term generation expansion planning in a competitive electricity industry. © 2015 The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.","Agent-based modeling;

This paper criticises the determination of the amount to procure, and argues that the amount set for the first auction was excessive, particularly (but not exclusively) in ignoring the contribution from interconnectors. Too little attention was given to either the political economy or the option value aspects. Procuring too little raises fears of 'the lights going out', but over-procurement increases consumer costs; undermines renewables by transferring capped finance to fossil generators; and impedes the Single Market including by weakening the business case for interconnectors. Making more use of the demand-side and potentially available 'latent' capacity lowers risk and increases options allowing more capacity procurement to be deferred. Capacity markets are intended to address problems of 'missing money' in terms of energy-only market incentives to invest; but over-procurement risks exacerbating the underlying problem, whereas addressing market failures and missing markets, and properly accounting for interconnectors, reduces the underlying problem.

In this regard, the focus is on Northwestern Europe. Because of the book’s functional perspective, it is not limited to the external regulation of electricity markets at the EU level and also describes the business models and practices employed by electricity producers. Both the physical and financial marketplaces are examined and topics including electricity supply, balancing, transmission and derivatives are covered. The target for the completion of the EU’s internal electricity market was 2014. The internal wholesale electricity market is very important not only for electricity producers, suppliers and major end consumers but also for network operators, marketplace operators, electricity technology firms, investment firms and market regulators. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,"(2013), Annual report on the results of monitoring the internal electricity and natural gas markets in 2012; Bhattacharyya, S.C., (2011) Energy economics: Concepts, issues, markets and governance, , Springer, Heidelberg; Chicco, G., Electricity market evolution in Europe (2009) Sci Bull Electr Eng Fac, 2009 (2), pp. 13-22; Frank, C.R., (2014) The net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies, , The Brookings Institution, Global Economy and Development Working Paper 73, May 2014; Fried, J., B.

This, in turn, can guide policymakers as to whether price spikes or bidding above marginal cost in wholesale electricity markets warrants any investigation at all. One of the seemingly complex areas associated with energy-only wholesale electricity pools is at what point market power abuse is present on the supply side. It should not be this way. If a theoretically robust measure of normal profit exists, identification of potential market power abuse is straightforward. Such a definition readily exists and can be traced back to the ground-breaking work of financial economists in the 1960s. Design/methodology/approach – Using a multi-period dynamic power project model, the authors produce pragmatic and theoretically robust measures of normal profit for project financed plant and plant financed on balance sheet. These model results are then integrated into a static partial equilibrium model of a power system. The model results are in turn used to guide policymaking on generator bidding in energy-only power markets. Findings – Under conditions of perfect plant availability and divisibility with no transmission constraints, energy-only markets result in clearing prices which are not economically viable in the long run. Bidding must, therefore, deviate from strict short-run marginal cost at some stage. To distinguish between quasi-contributions to substantial sunk costs and market power abuse, a pragmatic and robust measure of normal profit is required. Originality/value – This article finds policymakers can be guided by an ex-post analysis of base energy prices against pragmatic estimates for the long-run marginal cost of the base plant, and an ex-ante analysis of call option prices along the forward curve against pragmatic estimates of the carrying cost of the peaking plant. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","D61; Electricity prices; L11; L94; Profit; Project finance; Q40",,"(2012) Fuel cost projections, , www.aemo.com.au, Report to AEMO, ACIL Tasman Publication, Brisbane; Final rule determination: potential generator market power in the NEM (2013) AEMC Publication, Sydney, , www.aemc.gov.au; Berrie, T., The economics of system planning in bulk electricity supply (1967) Electrical Review, 22 (2), pp. 425-428; Besser, J., Farr, J., Tierney, S., The political economy of long-term generation adequacy: why an ICAP mechanism is needed as part of standard market design (2002) Electricity Journal, 15 (7), pp. 53-62. , pp; Bidwell, M., Henney, A., Will NETA ensure generation adequacy?

Given the uncertainty in future retail rates and the inherent links between rates and the customer-economics of behind-the-meter PV, there is growing interest in understanding how potential changes in rates may impact the value of bill savings from PV. In this article, we first use a production cost and capacity expansion model to project California hourly wholesale electricity market prices under two potential electricity market scenarios, including a reference and a 33% renewables scenario. Second, based on the wholesale electricity market prices generated by the model, we develop retail rates (i.e., flat, time-of-use, and real-time pricing) for each future scenario based on standard retail rate design principles. Finally, based on these retail rates, the bill savings from PV is estimated for 226 California residential customers under two types of net metering, for each scenario. We find that high renewable penetrations can drive substantial changes in residential retail rates and that these changes, together with variations in retail rate structures and PV compensation mechanisms, interact to place substantial uncertainty on the future value of bill savings from residential PV. © 2014.","Electricity rate design; Net metering; Photovoltaics",,"Alvarado, A., Levelized Costs of California Central Station Electricity Generation Technologies (2012) Presented at the California Energy Commission.

Payments to the generators have to ensure not only revenue adequacy but also incentivize the provision of an optimal amount of flexibility. This paper investigates the effects on global welfare of the introduction of (a) inexpensive storage and (b) a rolling horizon market design that supports the use of updated information. Such an environment could adversely affect some generators which could suffer significant losses due to additional commitment costs and may therefore decide to retire some generating units. This paper makes two contributions: First, it assesses the impact on welfare of uncertainty, a rolling horizon unit commitment, and the inclusion of storage. Second, it proposes a pricing mechanism that guarantees the profitability of all scheduled generators while maximizing the consumers' surplus and compares this mechanism with existing cost-recovery methods. Simulation results show that the proposed market design does not affect all the generators in the same manner but outperforms other methods in terms of efficiency. They also show that a shorter commitment horizon reduces the profitability of storage. © 2014 Power Systems Computation Conference.","Interval Optimization; Market Pricing; Rolling Horizon Unit Commitment; Storage","Commerce; Depreciation; Design; Economics; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Electricity market design; Interval optimization; Market pricing; Pricing mechanism; Renewable energy source; Revenue adequacy; Unit-commitment; Updated informations; Costs","Tuohy, A., Denny, E., O'Malley, M., Rolling unit commitment for systems with significant installed wind capacity (2007) Power Tech, 2007 IEEE Lausanne, pp. 1380-1385. , 1-5 July; Baldick, R., Helman, U., Hobbs, B.F., O'Neill, R.P., Design of efficient generation markets (2005) Proceedings of the IEEE, 93 (11), pp. 1998-2012. , Nov; Johnson, R.B., Oren, S.S., Svoboda, A.J., Equity and efficiency of unit commitment in competitive electricity markets (1997) Utilities Policy, 1 (6), pp. 9-19; Jiang, R., Wang, J., Guan, Y., Robust unit commitment with wind power and pumped storage hydro (2012) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 27 (2), pp. 800-810. , May; Wang, Y., Xia, Q., Kang, C., Unit commitment with volatile node injections by using interval optimization (2011) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 26 (3), pp. 1705-1713. , Aug; Bertsimas, D., Litvinov, E., Sun, X.A., Zhao, J., Zheng, T., Adaptive robust optimization for the security constrained unit commitment problem (2013) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 28 (1), pp. 52-63; Denholm, P., (2010) Role of Energy Storage with Renewable Electricity Generation, , http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/47187.pdf, Report NREL/TP-6A2-47187.

Generation adequacy and security of supply in power systems running under competition are currently topics of high concern for consumers, regulators and governments. In a market setting, generation investments and adequacy can only be achieved by an appropriate regulatory framework that sets efficient remuneration to power capacity. Theoretically, energy-only electricity markets are efficient and no additional mechanism is needed. Nonetheless, the energy-only market design suffers from serious drawbacks. Therefore, jointly with the evolution of electricity markets, many remunerating mechanisms for generation capacity have been proposed. Explicit capacity payment was the first remunerating approach implemented and perhaps still the most applied. However, this price-based regulation has been applied no without severe difficulties and criticism. In this paper, a new reliability payment mechanism is envisioned. Capacity of each generating unit is paid according to its effective contribution to overall system reliability. The proposed scheme has many attractive features and preserves the theoretical efficiency properties of energy-only markets. Fairness, incentive compatibility, market power mitigation and settlement rules are investigated in this work. The article also examines the requirements for system data and models in order to implement the proposed capacity mechanism. A numerical example on a real hydrothermal system serves for illustrating the practicability of the proposed approach and the resulting reliability payments to the generation units. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Adequacy; Investment; Power generation; Price spikes; Regulation; Supply reliability","Commerce; Economics; Energy efficiency; Power generation; Reliability; Commerce; Economics; Energy efficiency; Investments; Power generation; Reliability; Adequacy; Generation investment; Incentive compatibility; Market power mitigation; Price spike; Regulation; Regulatory frameworks; Supply reliability; Investments; Power markets; electricity industry; electricity supply; incentive; investment; power generation; price dynamics; regulatory framework; energy efficiency; energy policy; hydrothermal system","Allan, R.N., Navarro Sánchez, H., Uncertainty considerations in the pool purchase price in the England and Wales electricity supply industry (2004) IEEE Proc.

The investment framework consists of two levels of investment problems. The upper problem consists of an optimization problem which models the expected future investments from all the companies in the market over the lifetime of the investment plant that the company is evaluating. A ‘prototype’ of future investments and a retirement schedule are defined using dynamic programming. The lower problem corresponds to the profit evaluation of the new investment plant for each year against the ‘prototype’ investment schedule obtained in the upper problem. The capacity mechanism is included both in the prototype future system expansion formulation as well as in the net revenue calculation of the new plant. Two types of capacity mechanisms have been modeled in the investment framework, i.e. capacity payment and capacity market. The model has been tested using a test system based on Great Britain’s Seven Years Statement. Three types of investment technologies have been evaluated, i.e. nuclear, coal and CCGT. Results show that in the capacity payment proportional to the LOLP, a higher VOLL on average increases the investments from all the companies in the prototype system expansion. On the other hand, a steeper demand curve for the ICAP market results in more investments in the prototype expansion schedule. Comparing the three investment alternatives, a nuclear power plant which has a longer lifetime is the most riskiest and the most affected by the uncertainty in capacity payment and capacity market followed by the coal and the CCGT plants. © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. -All rights reserved.","Capacity Market; Capacity Payment; Dynamic Programming; Electricity Market; Generation Investment",,"Dahlan, N.Y., Kirschen, D.S., Valuation Model for Generation Investment in an Oligopoly Electricity Market (2010) Proceedings of Medpower; Oren, S.S., Ensuring Generation Adequacy in Competitive Electricity Markets (2003), University of California; Stoddard, R., Adamson, S., Comparing Capacity Market and Payment Designs for Ensuring Supply Adequacy (2009) 42Nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A Capacity Market that Makes Sense (2005) Electricity Journal, p. 18; Bunn, D.W., Erik, R.L., Sensitivity of Reserve Margin to Factors Influencing Investment Behaviour in the Electricity Market of England and Wales (1992) Energy Policy, p. 20; Ford, A., Cycles in Competitive Electricity Markets: A Simulation Study of the Western United States (1999) Energy Policy, p. 27; Han, C.-K., Hur, D., Sohn, J.-M., Park, J.-K., Assessing the Impacts of Capacity Mechanisms on Generation Adequacy with Dynamic Simulations (2011) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, , ; Ming-Che, H., Benjamin, F.H., Dynamic Analysis of Demand Curve Adjustment and Learning in Response to Generation Capacity Cost Dynamics in the PJM Capacity Market (2008), PES General Meeting; Hobbs, B.F., Ming-Che, H., Iñón, J.G., Stoft, S.E., Bhavaraju, M.P., A Dynamic Analysis of a Demand Curve-Based Capacity Market Proposal: The PJM Reliability Pricing Model (2007) IEEE Tranactions on Power System, p. 22; Joskow, P.L., (2006) Competitive Electricity Markets and Investment in New Generating Capacity, , MIT; Chandley, J.D., (2005) ICAP Reform Proposals in New England and PJM; (2010) PJM Capacity Market Operations, , PJM Manual 18: PJM Capacity Market; Oren, S.S., Ensuring Generation Adequacy in Competitive Electricity Markets (2003) Energy Policy and Economics, 7; Seven Years Statement (2010), http://www.nationalgrid.com, National Grid 2010; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A Capacity Market that Makes Sense (2005) Electricity Journal, p. 18","Dahlan, N.Y.; Universiti Teknologi Mara Shah Alam (UiTM)Malaysia",,"Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l",18276660,,,,"English","Int.

Based on the energy-only resource adequacy mechanism utilized in ERCOT, effective competition is defined by two major elements. The first element is active demand-side participation in the market and the second one is defining optimal price cap in the market to achieve efficient scarcity prices. Then, a dynamic model is proposed and different scenarios of effective competition are applied to two different market designs; energy-only market and energy market with capacity payments. Results show that increasing the price cap to approach to the Value of Lost Load (VOLL) and higher levels of demand-side participation in the market reduce the risk of generation inadequacy and mitigate the supply security problem in the investigated electricity market. Also, utilizing effective competition in energy markets with capacity payment mechanism triggers more investment in comparison with energy-only markets. © 2014 IEEE.","Demand-side participation; Effective competition; German energy market; Price cap; Supply security problem","Commerce; Costs; Electric industry; Investments; Capacity payment mechanism; Demand-side; Energy markets; Energy-only market; Model-based analysis; Price caps; Supply security; Value of lost load; Competition","Sioshansi, F.P., Evolution of global electricity markets - New Paradigms, New Challenges, New Approaches (2013) Elsevier; Haas, R., On managing the integration of large shares of renewables in electricity supply systems (2013) IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference APPEEC; Bauknecht, D., Brunekreeft, G., Meyer, R., From niche to mainstream: The evolution of renewable energy in the German electricity market (2013) Evolution of Global Electricity Markets - New Paradigms, , F.

Introduction of such a mechanism would ensure an adequate level of generation capacity, which would directly affect the ability to maintain electricity prices at a socially acceptable level. Similar solutions have been already introduced in the United States. Recently such mechanisms have been implemented in the UK and France. The introduction of the article presents the current state of the Polish power sector, pointing out the exploitation of currently operating power generation units. Then the methodological framework of the functioning of capacity markets was provided. Consequently, discussions of key aspects of a possible implementation of the capacity market mechanism in the context of the Polish power sector was carried out. In summary it was indicated that regardless of the general model of capacity market (centralized or decentralized) that will be selected, the success of its implementation will rely upon the final shape of the detailed regulations.","Capacity markets; Investments; Regulations",,"(2010) 2010/75/Ue - Dyrektywa Parlamentu europejskiego I Rady 2010/75/Ue Z Dnia 24 Listopada, , r. w sprawie emisji przemysłowych zintegrowane zapobieganie zanieczyszczeniom i ich kontrola; (2013) ACeR - Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms and the Internal Market for electricity, , The Agency for the Cooperation of energy Regulators; (2012) Statystyka elektroenergetyki Polskiej, , ARe, Warszawa 2012; Ausubel, L.M., Cramton, P., Using forward markets to improve electricity market design (2010) Utilities Policy, , 25 May; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense (2005) The electricity Journal, 18 (7), pp. 43-54; De Vries, L., Heijnen, P., The impact of electricity market design upon investment under uncertainty: The effectiveness of capacity mechanisms (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 215-227; Electricity Market Reform (eMR): Capacity Market expert Group, , https://www.gov.uk/government/policy-Advisory-groups/capacity-market-emr-expert-group, data dostepu 23.09.2014r; Electricity Market Reform: Capacity Market - Detailed Design Proposals, , https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/209280/15398_TSO_Cm_8637_DeCC_electricity_Market-reform_web-optimised.pdf.June2013, data dostepu 23.09.2014r; Finon, D., Incentives to invest in liberalised electricity industries in the North and South (2006) Differences in the Need for Suitable Institutional Arrangements, 34 (5), pp. 601-618. , energy Policy; (2013) Sprawozdanie W Wyników Monitorowania Bezpieczenstwa Dostaw energii elektrycznej, , MG, Ministerstwo Gospodarki.

We argue that RES integration is an issue of economic efficiency, and we review the main frameworks that have emerged in the literature. We first consider to what extent intermittent resources should be treated as dispatchable resources. We then analyse the different tools that have been proposed to ensure the required flexibility would be delivered, with an emphasis on the redefinition of time and space, joint optimisation of reserve products and energy products, and Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity mechanisms; Electricity market design; Intermittency; Large-scale renewables","economic integration; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy market; energy use","Ambec, S., Crampes, C., Electricity provision with intermittent sources of energy (2012) Res.

In an energyonly market, the price received for electricity produced is set by the marginal generation unit. Potentially, the designs of these markets could leave the owners of these units with 'missing money'. Among the different options available to tackle the missing money problem, capacity mechanisms have attracted most of the attention in recent policy debates in Europe. This paper presents the results based on a quantitative analysis by using a model of the European electricity market (COMPETES). Our analysis shows that unilateral introduction of a German capacity market in an integrated European electricity market can have considerable impacts on investment decisions and cross border electricity flows. Stand-alone introduction of a capacity market in Germany will likely result in higher investments in Germany at the expense of lower investments outside Germany and an increase in net exports from Germany. Neighbouring countries may have possibility to free ride on the increase in flexible capacity in Germany. The corresponding impacts are likely to be increased by the availability and expansion of interconnection capacities, hampering the level playing field within Europe. This conflicts with EU's long-term efficiency goal of market integration. © 2013 IEEE.","capacity markets; energy-only electricity markets; equilibrium; generation capacity; optimization","Capacity markets; Electricity generation capacity; Electricity market; Generation capacity; Interconnection capacity; Investment decisions; Level playing fields; Market integration; Electric industry; International trade; Optimization; Phase equilibria; Investments","Bushnell, J., Harvey, S., Hobbs, B., Oren, S., (2012) Opinion on Flexible Capacity Procurement: Risk, , ^/Retirement, Folsom, CA, USA; Stoft, S., (2002) Power System Economics: Designing Markets/or Electricity, , Hoboken, NJ: Wiley; Schweppe, F., Caramanis, M., Tabers, R., Bohn, R., (1988) Spot Pricing Oj Electricity, , Boston, MA Kluwer Academic Publishers; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense (2005) Electricity Journal, 18 (7), pp. 43-54; Joskow, P., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets:need and design (2008) Utility Policies, 16 (3), pp. 159-170; Elberg, C., Growitsch, C., Hoffler, F., Richter, J., Wambach, A., Untersuchungen zu einem zukunftsfahigen strommarktdesign (2012) EWI, , Cologne; Meulman, L., Meray, N., Capacity mechanisms in northwest europe: Between a rock and a hard place (2012) CIEP, , Den Haag; De Vries, L., (2004) Securing the Public Interest in Electricity Generation Markets, , PhD. dissertation, TU Delft, Delft; Doorman, G., Botterud, A., Wolfgang, O., (2007) A Comparative Analysis of Capacity Adequacy Policies, , unpublished, Stockholm, Sweden; Cramton, P., Ockenfels, A., Economics and design of capacity markets for the power sector (2012) Zeitschrift Fiir Energiewirtschaft, 36 (1), pp. 113-134; Beurskens, L., Hekkenberg, M., Vethman, P., Renewable energy projections as published in the national renewable energy action plans of the European Member States (2011) ECN, , Petten, The Netherlands; Ten-year network development plan 2010-2020 (2010) European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, , http:entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_uploadMibrary/SDC/TYNDP/ TYNDP-final_document.pdf, ENTSO-E Accessed 6 May 2011; Hobbs, B., Rijkers, F., Strategic generation with conjectured transmission price responses in a mixed transmission system I: Formulation (2004) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 19 (2), pp. 707-717; Ehrenmann, A., Smeers, Y., Stochastic equilibrium models for generation capacity expansion (2011) Stochastic Optimization Methods in Finance and Energy, 163, pp. 273-310. , M.

This is important in particular for the electricity industry where private firms invest into generation facilities, while network investments usually are controlled by regulators. We discuss two regulatory regimes. First, the regulator can only decide on the network extension. Second, she can additionally use a ""capacity market"" with payments contingent on private generation investment. For the first case, we find that even absent asymmetric information, a lack of regulatory commitment can cause inefficiently high or inefficiently low investments. For the second case, we develop a standard handicap auction which implements the first best under asymmetric information if there are no shadow costs of public funds. With shadow costs, no simple mechanism can implement the second best outcome. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Capacity markets; Commitment; Regulation; Transmission system investment",,"Bushnell, J.B., Stoft, S.E., Electric grid investment under a contract network regime (1996) Journal of Regulatory Economics, 10, pp. 61-79; Chao, H.-P., Peck, S., A market mechanism for electric power transmission (1996) Journal of Regulatory Economics, 10 (1), pp. 25-59; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense (2005) Electricity Journal, 18 (7), pp. 43-54; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., (2006) The convergence of market design for adequate generating capacity, , White paper for the Electricity Oversight Board; Eso, P., Szentes, B., Optimal information disclosure in auctions and the handicap auction (2007) Review of Economic Studies, 74, pp. 705-731; Höffler, F., Kranz, S., (2010) Using forward contracts to reduce regulatory capture"", , SFB/TR 15 Discussion Paper 320; Hogan, W., Rosellon, J., Vogelsang, I., Toward a comined merchant-regulatory mechanism for electricity transmission expansion (2010) Journal of Regulatory Economics, 38, pp. 113-143; Hogan, W.W., (2005) On an ""Energy Only"" Electricity Market Design for Ressource Adequacy, , Mimeo: Harvard University; Joskow, P.J., Restructuring, competition and regulatory reform in the U.S. electricity sector (1997) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 11 (3), pp. 119-138; Joskow, P.J., Tirole, J., Merchant transmission investment (2005) Journal of Industrial Economics, 53 (2), pp. 233-264; Joskow, P.L., Capacity payments in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2008) Utilities Policy, 16, pp. 159-170; Leautier, T.-O., Regulation of an electric power transmission company (2000) Energy Journal, 21 (4), pp. 61-92; Leautier, T.-O., Thelen, V., Optimal expansion of the power transmission grid: Why not?

The success of recent renewable promotion schemes adds a new dimension to ensuring long-term security of supply: it necessitates designing second-best policies to prevent large-scale wind power development from distorting long-run equilibrium prices and investments in conventional generation and in particular in peaking units. We rely upon a long-term simulation model which simulates electricity market players' investment decisions in a market regime and incorporates large-scale wind power development in the presence of either subsidized or market driven development scenarios. We test the use of capacity mechanisms to compensate for long-term effects of large-scale wind power development on prices and reliability of supply. The first finding is that capacity mechanisms can help to reduce the social cost of large scale wind power development in terms of decrease of loss of load probability. The second finding is that, in a market-based wind power deployment without subsidy, wind generators are penalised for insufficient contribution to the long term system's reliability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity mechanism; Electricity markets; Generation adequacy; Wind power","Conventional generation; Development scenarios; Electricity market; Generation adequacy; Investment decisions; Large-scale wind power; Reliability of supply; Wind generator systems; Commerce; Computer simulation; Costs; Economics; Investments; Loss of load probability; Wind power; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy policy; policy approach; renewable resource; resource development; wind power","Assili, M., Javidi, H., Ghazi, R., An improved mechanism for capacity payment based on system dynamics modeling for investment planning in competitive electricity environment (2008) EnergyPolicy, 36 (10), pp. 3703-3713; Boiteux, M., La tarification des demandes en pointe: application de la théorie de la vente au coÛt marginal (1949) Revue Générale de l'Électricité, 58 (8), pp. 321-334. , (translated as ""Peak-load Pricing"" Journal Business, April 1960, 33, 157-179; reprinted in: Nelson, James R.

The main reasons are that only some of the activities involved in the supply of electricity have been subject to an in-depth reform, most governments still have a heavy hand on their power sectors and the volume and complexity of the new regulation is frequently similar, or even greater, than the so-called traditional regulatory framework, see (Borenstein and Bushnell 2000) or (Ruff 2003). This is why the term ""restructuring"" has been preferred in some electric power systems (particularly in the United States).

Currently, some problems about the peak-regulating auxiliary services exist in six major power grid regions such as the single standard of compensation for deep peak-regulating of the thermal power units, small and medium capacity units with weaker peak-regulating capacity can barely obtain compensation. The unfairness during the existing peak-regulating auxiliary service compensation mechanisms leads to the consequence that a large number of thermal power units lack the incentives of providing peak-regulating auxiliary services. K-means cluster analysis is used to classify the units based on the unit capacity and the highest peaking rate indicators, and then the boundary line between basic peak-regulating and deep peak-regulating across various units is identified. Moreover, a new auxiliary service compensation model is put forward to encourage more units providing peak-regulating auxiliary services during low-load period, thus increasing stability of the electricity grid as well as promoting more wind power integration into the grid. The case studies of 63 units dispatched by the Northeast Power Grid are given to verify the effectiveness of the improved model on encouraging more thermal power units to participate in the provision of peak-regulating auxiliary services. © 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.","Compensation mechanism; K-means clustering; Peak-regulating ancillary services; Thermal power units","Ancillary service; Auxiliary services; Compensation mechanism; K-means cluster analysis; K-means clustering; Penetration level; Thermal power units; Wind power integrations; Cluster analysis; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Wind power; Fossil fuel power plants","Zhang, N., Zhou, T., Duan, C., Impact of large-scale wind farm connecting with power grid on peak load regulation demand (2010) Power System Technology, 34 (1), pp. 152-158; Wang, P., Zhang, L., Liang, L., A method for division of paid peak-regulation and free peak-regulation for thermal power units (2010) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 34 (9), pp. 87-90; Xie, J., Bai, X., Wei, J., Study on peaking cost compensation in Northwest China power grid (2009) Journal of Zhejiang University: Engineering Science, 43 (3), pp. 584-588; Zhang, J., Cao, Z., Xu, H., A novel model for ancillary service payment in generation market (2002) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 26 (10), pp. 9-12; Hu, J., Hu, F., A novel compensation mechanism of remunerative peak load regulation under energy-saving dispatch framework (2009) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 33 (10), pp. 35-42; Wang, K., Huang, B., Si, P., Research on influencing factors of peak-regulation margin in power plant units (2012) Energy Conservation Technology, 30 (171), pp. 52-54; Zhang, H., Yin, Y., Shen, H., Peak-load regulating adequacy evaluation associated with large-scale wind power integration (2011) Proceedings of the CSEE, 31 (22), pp. 26-31","Zhao, X.; Economics and Management School, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China; email: email99zxl@vip.sina.com",,,10001026,,DXZIE,,"Chinese","Dianli Xitong Zidonghue",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874973207

The initial enthusiasm that existed for investment in existing and new merchant power plant capacity shortly after power system deregulation has progressively dissipated, following an excess entry result. In this article, we demonstrate why this has become a global trend. Using debt-sizing parameters typically used by project banks, we model a benchmark plant, then re-simulate its performance using live energy market price data and find that such financings are no longer feasible in the absence of long-term Power Purchase Agreements. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric utilities; Energy prices; Project finance","Deregulated energy market; Energy markets; Energy prices; Forward market; Global trends; Merchant power plants; Power producer; Power purchase agreement; Power system deregulation; Project finance; Stand-alone generators; Benchmarking; Commerce; Electric utilities; Investments; electrical power; electricity generation; energy market; energy policy; power plant","ACIL Tasman (2007) Fuel Resource, New Entry and Generation costs in the NEM, , ACIL Tasman, Brisbane; ACIL Tasman (2009) Fuel Resource, New Entry and Generation Costs in the NEM, , ACIL Tasman, Brisbane; ACIL Tasman (2011), http://www.qca.org.au, Draft methodology for Estimating Energy Purchase Costs.

This is reduced as the government, regulator and system operator take on explicit responsibility through the introduction of capacity mechanisms and long-term support for clean technologies. We highlight the interaction of these mechanisms with the electricity market and we look at how they reallocate risks between generators, government and consumers. The different mechanisms offer varying degrees of autonomy to generators with regards investment decisions. Looking towards the future, the paper also explores how designs of mechanisms might move towards a technology-neutral mechanism in the long-run. This could involve the auctioning of long-term contracts for all types of existing and new capacities, whether it be low carbon or fossil fuelled. © 2013 by the IAEE.

While CSP plants without TES have capacity values ranging between 60% and 86% of maximum capacity, plants with TES can have capacity values between 79% and 92%. We demonstrate the effect of location and configuration on the operation and capacity value of CSP plants. We also show that using a capacity payment mechanism can increase the capacity value of CSP, since the capacity value of CSP is highly sensitive to operational decisions and energy prices are not a perfect indicator of scarcity of supply. © 2012 IEEE.","Capacity value; Concentrating solar power; Equivalent conventional power","Capacity payment mechanism; Capacity value; Concentrating solar power; Concentrating solar power plant; Conventional power; Energy prices; Operational decisions; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Heat storage","Keane, A., Milligan, M.R., Dent, C.J., Hasche, B., D'Annunzio, C., Dragoon, K., Holttinen, H., O'Malley, M., Capacity value of wind power (2011) IEEE Trans.

When the penetration level of wind generation increases in grid, dynamic and transient behaviour of the system get affected. To maintain the reliability of the system, well defined grid codes are to be formed that has to be followed by independent power producers to avoid wind energy curtailment and ensure quality of power available in grid. Given the intermittent nature of wind, the subject of various storage mechanisms becomes critical to avail energy scheduling from a wind farm. This paper undertakes an exhaustive study of various wind electric generators and grid integration technologies along with the grid codes. The review highlights that direct driven generators dominate in recent installations due to their superior performance compared with other generator configurations. Consequently, a permanent magnet synchronous generator based gearless wind electric system along with battery energy storage is modeled and its performance is evaluated. The grid codes that are to be followed are also incorporated in the model. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Fault Ride Through; Grid Codes; Integrated Operation; Wind Energy",,"(2012) Renewable Global Status Report, , www.gwec.net, June [Online].

In a competitive market environment, the provision and development of this flexibility is driven by the remuneration of flexibility providers. This paper proposes an approach to quantify the profit that market participants derive from providing flexibility services. This is based on the simulation of forward (day-ahead) and real-time balancing markets. In addition, a more flexible market design (rolling commitment) in which a periodic re-optimization is performed to take advantage of updated wind. Test results based on the IEEE RTS-96 are used to compare the profitability of flexibility for different market designs and to assess the effect of the wind forecast error and other parameters on this profitability. The results have shown that with the proposed market design and the associated payment scheme, generators can obtain profit for providing flexibility services as wind penetration increases and the error of the wind forecast and the flexible market design has a significant influence on this profitability. © 2012 IEEE.","day-ahead market; flexibility; generation profits; integration of wind generation; real-time balancing market; rolling-commitment","Balancing market; Day ahead market; flexibility; rolling-commitment; Wind generation; Design; Profitability; Weather forecasting; Commerce","Alhajali, M., Impact of wind variability on weakly interconnected power systems (2010) Power and Energy Society General Meeting, pp. 1-6; Conlon, M.F., Carr, W., Generation adequacy assessment incorporating wind energy capacity (2004) Universities Power Engineering Conference, 2, pp. 1014-1018; The Facts (WindFacts), , http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org, [Online]; Lu, B., Shahidehpour, M., Unit commitment with flexible generating units (2005) IEEE Transactions on Power System, 20, pp. 1022-1034; Shuai, L., Unit commitment considering generation flexibility and environmental constraints (2010) Power and Energy Society General Meeting, pp. 1-11; Jazayeri, P., A survey of load control programs for price and system stability (2005) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 20, pp. 1504-1509; Moreno, J.A.F., An integrated tool for assessing the demand profile flexibility (2004) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 19, pp. 668-675; Bai, J., A probabilistic reserve market incorporating interruptible load (2006) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 21, pp. 1079-1087; Bai, J., A probabilistic reserve market incorporating interruptible load (2006) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 21, pp. 1079-1087; Silva, V.S.V., Benefits of storage and DSM in transmission congestion management in systems with high wind penetration (2008) 7th International Workshop on Large Scale Integration of Wind Power and on Transmission Networks for Offshore Wind Farms, , presented at the, May; Castronuovo, E.D., Lopes, J.A.P., On the optimization of the daily operation of a wind-hydro power plant (2004) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 19, pp. 1599-1606; Ummels, B.C., Integration of large-scale wind power and use of energy storage in the netherlands' electricity supply (2008) IET Renewable Power Generation, 2, pp. 34-46; Ntotas, K., Flexible international exchanges: A possible solution for large &#x2014; Scale wind power integration (2009) PowerTech, 2009 IEEE Bucharest, pp. 1-8; Ma, J., Kirschen, D.S., Belhomme, R., Silva, V., Optimizing the flexibility of a portfolio of generating plants (2010) The 17th Power Systems Computation Conference, , Stockholm Sweden; Silva, V.S.V., (2010) Value of Flexibility in Systems with Large Wind Penetration, , Ph.D Thesis, Imperial College London, London; Bouffard, F., Ortega-Vazquez, M., The value of operational flexibility in power systems with significant wind power generation (2011) Power and Energy Society General Meeting, pp. 1-5; Tuohy, A., Rolling unit commitment for systems with significant installed wind capacity Power Tech, 2007 IEEE Lausanne, pp. 1380-1385; Ummels, B.C., (2009) Power System Operation with Larg E-Scale Wind Power in Liberalised Environments, , PhD, University Delft; Mendes, D.P., Kirschen, D.S., Assessing pool-based pricing mechanisms in competitive electricity markets (2000) Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting, 4, pp. 2195-2200; Mary, B., Goran, S., Value of bulk energy storage for managing wind power fluctuations (2007) IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, 22, pp. 197-205; Boehme, T., (2006) Matching Renewable Electricity Generation with Demand, , Edinburgh.

Several variations of capacity mechanisms have been proposed for this purpose. This study presents the theoretical basis of how concepts of a forward capacity market (FCM) can be applied for hydrothermal systems with significant portion of hydro generation, and a dynamic simulation model to assess the performance of an FCM under different levels of competitive conditions, ranging from monopoly to perfect competition. At each annual step of the simulation, the proposed model uses game theory to describe the strategic interdependence among the generators, which results in an optimisation problem that allows finding the total amount of new capacity to be added to the system. The solution of the game also takes into account the behaviour of entrant generators when faced with the uncertainties regarding demand growth and future water inflows. The main contribution of this study is to model the strategic behaviour of investors in generation. The proposed model is capable of reproducing classical economic results for complex cases such as asymmetric oligopoly, which considers uncertainty in the demand growth rate and risk averse players. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2012.",,"Behaviour of investors; Capacity investment; Economic results; Generation resources; Hydrothermal system; Optimisation problems; Perfect competition; Simulation model; Commerce; Competition; Investments; Computer simulation","Sioshansi, F.P., Pfaffenberger, W., Electricity market reform: an international perspective Elsevier Science, Oxford, UK, 2006, 1st edn; Besser, J.G., Farr, J.G., Tierney, S.F., The political economy of long-term generation adequacy: why an ICAP mechanism is needed as part of standard market design (2002) Electr.

However, DR applications in a worldwide context have been slow, especially in the industrial and commercial sector. Despite this, emerging countries have great opportunities to internalize these policies in their energy planning and economic growth programs, so as to maximize their use as a tool integrated to energy markets. DR may allow to deal with the risks associated with system demand and to satisfy the reliability needs of an active and dynamic energy market. For this to take place, one should migrate to active and dynamic demand response, under reliability criteria based on the smart grid paradigm.

Furthermore, we implement a basic capacity payment mechanism similar to the Spanish one in the existing agent-based electricity market model PowerACE to analyze the impact of such a capacity payment mechanism on the long-term development of investments in conventional capacities and on electricity prices. Considering different scenarios for future energy carrier and CO 2 prices, we find that investments are carried out earlier in a system with capacity payments. Also, more capacities are built in the presence of a capacity market. The damping effect on electricity prices is visible but dependent on the development of energy carrier prices and on the characteristics of the payment mechanism. © 2012 IEEE.","adequacy; agent-based simulation; capacity payments; electricity market","adequacy; Agent based; Agent based simulation; Capacity markets; Capacity payment mechanism; Capacity payments; Damping effect; Electricity market; Electricity market model; Electricity prices; Energy carriers; Future energies; Long-term development; Model-based analysis; Payment mechanism; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electricity; Investments; Commerce","De Vries, L., Generation adequacy: Helping the market do its job (2007) Utilities Policy, 15 (1), pp. 20-35; Stoft, S., (2002) Power System Economics: Designing Markets for Electricity, , Wiley-IEEE; Schweppe, F., (1998) Spot Pricing of Electricity, , Kluwer Academic Publishers; Neuhoff, K., Vries, L.D., Insufficient incentives for investment in electricity generations (2004) Utilities Policy, 12 (4), pp. 253-267; (2010) Glossary of Terms, , European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electrcity (ENTSO-E); Oren, S., (2003) Ensuring Generation Adequacy in Competitive Electricity Markets, , Department of IEOR, University of California at Berkeley; Roques, F., (2008) Market Design for Generation Adequacy: Healing Causes Rather Than Symptoms; Süssenbacher, W., Schwaiger, M., Stigler, H., Kapazitätsmärkte- und Mechanismen im internationalen Kontext Proceedings of the 7th EnInnov, Vienna, 2011; Süssenbacher, W., Schwaiger, M., Stigler, H., (2010) PJM Kapazitätsbörse - Reliability Pricing Model, , TU Graz; Pfeifenberger, J., Spees, K., Schumacher, A., (2009) A Comparison of PJM's RPM with Alternative Energy and Capacity Market Designs, , The Brattle Group, September; Pfeifenberger, J., Spees, K., (2011) Evaluation of Market Fundamentals and Challenges to Long-Term System Adequacy in Alberta's Electricity Market, , The Brattle Group, April; Ockenfels, A., Marktdesign und Experimentelle Wirtschaftsforschung (2008) Working Paper Series in Economics, 41. , Department of Economics, Universität Köln, Köln; Genoese, M., Price spreads in electricity markets: What are the fundamental drivers?

This problem appears when generators do not recover their costs given the market price of electricity. The ""missing money"" problem may be in part due to the pricing and payment mechanisms set in place. Competitive forces should set the price of a commodity to the marginal cost of the marginal unit producing the good if the functions are convex. However, electricity markets are characterised for having non-convex function due to the generators' minimum and maximum outputs constraints, start up and shut down costs, amongst other characteristics. Therefore, uniform marginal price schemes will not always create market-clearing price. Under this scheme, not all the generators will cover the costs incurred in production. Different recovery mechanisms have been proposes, but the case of the ""missing money"" is still a challenge these days, especially in pool-based markets. A possible solution is to price for capacity as well as for the electricity. Capacity markets have developed, and they still are in progress. And although some authors are not supporters of capacity payments and capacity markets, some others have shown the need for capacity payments and suggested a design for its market. This paper contributes to the growing literature in capacity pricing by suggesting a new approach to obtain electricity prices and capacity prices for the plants engaged into production. This approach applies the semi-Lagrangean methodology to an expanded Unit Commitment and Dispatch Problem. The expanded problem includes an extra constraint that sets the total capacity engaged to its optimal value. The new semi-Lagrangean problem is solved by using a subgradient approach. We obtain a set of prices for electricity and capacity that are high enough to cover the generators' costs, as well as sending the right signals to the market, and producing efficiently at a minimum costs. We believe that the excess revenue obtained with this approach can be used as a guide to future investment, and as a consequence, can help to find the ""missing money"". © 2012 IEEE.","Capacity Price; Mathematical Programming; Non-convexities; Recovery Mechanisms; Unit Commitment","Capacity markets; Capacity payments; Capacity Price; Dispatch problems; Electricity market; Electricity prices; Marginal costs; Marginal units; Market design; Market price; Maximum output; Minimum cost; Non-convexities; Nonconvex functions; Optimal values; Payment mechanism; Pool-based; Recovery mechanisms; Subgradient; Uniform marginal price; Unit Commitment; Wholesale electricity markets; Commerce; Economics; Electric generators; Electricity; Mathematical programming; Plant shutdowns; Recovery; Costs","Joskow, P.L., Capacity mechanisms in imperfect electricity markets: Need and design (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 159-170; Bouffard, F., Galiana, F., (2005) Generalized Uplifts in Pool Based Electricity Markets, , Springer; Madrigal, M., Quintana, V., Using optimization models and techniques to implement electricity auctions (2000) IEEE Power Engineering Society Winter Meeting 2000, pp. 897-902. , I.

In particular, the power system will need resources capable of rapidly changing output or fexing demand frequently and continuously throughout the year around the energy availability from variable renewables. Based on these requirements and related considerations, we develop a set of market design principles that can be used to assess the suitability of proposals intended to deliver system reliability. The proposal to introduce a capacity payment mechanism being considered for Great Britain is reviewed against these criteria. Our analysis suggests that it will not be capable of meeting the system reliability challenges or taking advantage of emerging opportunities ahead. © 2012 IEEE.","capacity markets; Power system reliability; renewable integration","Capacity markets; Capacity payment mechanism; Energy availability; Great Britain; Market design; Power system reliability; Renewable integration; Renewables; System reliability; Energy management; Energy resources; Commerce","(2011) Energy Roadmap 2050, , http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy2020/roadmap/doc/com_2011_8852_en.pdf, COM (2011) 885/2.

We implement a dynamic model in which firms compete for investment and electricity production under imperfect Cournot competition. The main aim of this work is to compare three investment incentive mechanisms: reliability options, forward capacity market and capacity payments. Apart from the oligopoly case, we also analyze collusion and monopoly cases. Dynamic programming is used to deal with the stochastic environment of the market and mixed complementarity problem and variational inequality formulations are employed to find a solution to the game. The main finding of this study is that market-based mechanisms would be the most cost-efficient mechanism for assuring long-term system capacity adequacy. Moreover, generators would exert market power when introducing capacity payments. Finally, compared with a Cournot oligopoly, collusion and monopolistic situations lead to more installed capacities with marketbased mechanisms and increase consumers' payments.

So far, many diverse designs of capacity mechanisms have been proposed in relation to the adequacy problem. Researchers have conducted many qualitative studies of capacity mechanisms, but quantitative studies have largely been ignored. The framework for examining the impacts of market designs on generation adequacy considering various generation technologies have not been maturely developed. This paper focuses on developing this framework and finding out how effective capacity mechanisms are in different market conditions. To cover investment under uncertainty, we will introduce different utility functions representing risk attitudes and apply the expected utility theory to the investment decision. Finally, we will examine the investment decision sensitivity of the risk components such as the risk-attitude, the error of forecast peak load, and the forced outage rate and evaluate the performance of three market designs with dynamic simulations: an energy-only market, a capacity payment model, and a capacity demand curve model. © 2006 IEEE.","Capacity mechanism; energy-only market; expected utility theory; generation adequacy; generation investment","Capacity mechanism; Energy-only market; expected utility theory; Generation adequacy; Generation investment; Commerce; Computer simulation; Decision theory; Design; Dynamics; Investments","(1985) 8Reliability Concepts in Bulk Power Electric Systems, Reliability Criteria Subcommittee, , North American Electric Reliability Council; Hughes, W.R., Parece, A., The economics of price spikes in deregulated power markets (2002) Elect.

Differences between regulatory policies and market designs in terms of generation adequacy policies may distort the normal functioning of the neighboring markets, as well as the reliability of supply. We test the effect of heterogeneous regulatory design between two interdependent markets: energy-only market, price-capped market without capacity mechanisms and price-capped markets with forward capacity contracts obligation. We rely on a long-term market simulation model in system dynamics that characterizes expansion decision in a competitive regime. The results show that differences in market designs affect both price and reliability of supply in the two markets. We examine both the short and long terms effect, and how free-riding may occur where capacity adequacy policies are adopted in one market but not the other. The main finding is that the lack of harmonization between local markets in policies to ensure capacity adequacy may lead to undesirable side effects. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity adequacy; Interconnection; Reliability","Capacity adequacy; Electricity market; Energy-only market; Free-riding; Generation adequacy; Generation capacity adequacy; Interconnection; Local markets; Long term; Market design; Market simulation; Practical problems; Regional electricity markets; Regulatory policies; Reliability of supply; Security of supply; Side effect; System Dynamics; Transmission constraint; Computer simulation; Design; Reliability; Commerce; computer simulation; decision making; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy planning; energy policy; numerical model; planning theory; policy strategy; regulatory approach; theoretical study","Assili, M., Javidi, H., Ghazi, R., An improved mechanism for capacity payment based on system dynamics modeling for investment planning in competitive electricity environment (2008) Energy Policy, 36 (10), pp. 3703-3713; Bunn, D., Larsen, E., Sensitivity reserve margin to factors influencing investment behavior in the electricity market of England and Wales (1992) Energy Policy, 20 (5), pp. 420-429; (2009), http://www.cne.es, Comisión Nacional de Energía Informe Marco Sobre La Demanda Energía Eléctrica Y Gas Natural, Y Su Cobertura, Año 2006. 〈〉; (2009), http://www.cre.fr, CRE 'Communication de la Commission de régulation de l'énergie (CRE) sur le pic de prix de l'électricité du 19 octobre 2009. 〈〉; Creti, A., Fabra, N., Capacity markets of electricity, (communication to the colloquium efficiency electricity markets, Toulouse, December 2003) (2004) Journal of Regulatory Economics; De Vries, L., Generation adequacy: Helping the market do its job (2007) Utilities Policy, 15 (1), pp. 20-35; De Vries, L., Heijnen, P., The impact of electricity market design upon investment under uncertainty: The effectiveness of capacity mechanisms (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 2015-2227; E-Control E-Control-The Austrian Regulatory Commission (2009), http://www.e-control.at, 〈〉; Finon, D., Pignon, V., Electricity and long-term capacity adequacy: The quest for regulatory mechanism compatible with electricity market (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 143-158; Ford, A., System dynamics and the electric power industry (1997) System Dynamics Review, 13 (1), pp. 57-85; Ford, A., Cycles in competitive electricity markets: A simulation study of the western United States (1999) Energy Policy, 27 (11), pp. 637-658; Ford, A., Vogstad, K., Flynn, H., Simulating price patterns for tradable green certificates to promote electricity generation from wind (2007) Energy Policy, 35 (1), pp. 91-111; Forrester, J., (1961) Industrial Dynamics, , MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass; Joskow, P., et Kahn, E., A quantitative analysis of pricing behavior in California's wholesale market during summer 2000 (2002) The Energy Journal, 23 (4), pp. 1-35; Ochoa, P., Policy changes in the Swiss electricity market: Analysis of likely market responses (2007) Socio-economic Planning Sciences, 41 (4), pp. 336-349; Ojeda, O., Olsina, F., Garces, F., (2009) Simulation of the long-term dynamic of a market-based transmission interconnection, 37 (8), pp. 2889-2899; Olsina, F., Garces, F., Haubrich, H.J., Modeling long-term dynamics of electricity markets (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (12), pp. 1411-1433; (2009), http://www.rte-france.com, RTE, Bilan prévisionnel 2009. 〈〉; Sterman, J., Modeling the formation of expectations: the history of energy demand forecasts (1988) International Journal of Forecasting, 4 (2), pp. 243-259; Sterman, J.D., (2000) Business dynamics: System thinking and modeling for a complex world, , Irwin/McGraw-Hill, Boston; Stoft, S., PJM's Capacity Market in a Price-Spike World (2000), University of California Energy Institute.

The objective of the model is to maximize the bidder's competitiveness while ensuring that the project's target rate of return is achieved with a given probability, for example 95%. The problem's complexity is compounded by uncertainties in fuel supply and the need to switch between fuels. The generators face the conundrum of bidding a single strike price to cover the expenses generated by using multiple types of fuels. We address the problem of finding bidding strategies which, taking into account uncertainty in fuel supply and risk constraints, set the combination of strike price and option premium that ensure a desired risk-adjusted return for greenfield dual-fuel thermal plants. © 2010 IEEE.","Energy call options; generation adequacy; power system economics; power system planning","Bidding strategy; Dual-fuels; Energy call options; Fuel supply; generation adequacy; Greenfield; power system economics; power system planning; Rate of return; Risk constraints; Risk-adjusted; Stochastic optimization model; Thermal plants; Competition; Earnings; Stochastic models; Fuels","Schweppe, F.C., Caramanis, M.C., Tabors, R.D., Bohn, R.E., (1988) Spot Pricing of Electricity, , Boston MA: Kluwer; Implementing power rationing in a sensible way: Lessons learned and international best practices (2005) ESMAP\World Bank; Oren, S., Ensuring generation adequacy in competitive electricity markets (2005) Electricity Deregulation: Choices and Challenges, , J.

The occurrence of cycles is one of the major threats for electricity markets as it affects the security of supply, and creates uncertainty in both the profitability of electricity companies and in consumer prices. We discuss the background for these cycles using analogies with other capital-intensive industries, along with evidence from the analysis of behavioral simulation models as well as from experimental electricity markets. Using data from the oldest deregulated markets we find support for the hypothesis in the case of the English and Chilean markets, based on an autocorrelation analysis. Evidence from the Nordpool market is more ambiguous, although we might be observing the first half of a cycle in generation capacity. Comparing a simulation of the English market performed in 1992 with the actual performance we can observe that the qualitative behavior of the model is consistent with the actual evolution. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms for damping cycles in electricity generation, such as mothballing, capacity payments, and reliability markets. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cycles; Deregulation; Electricity markets","Autocorrelation analysis; Behavioral simulation; Capacity payments; Capital-intensive industry; Consumer prices; Cycles; Deregulated electricity market; Deregulated markets; Electricity companies; Electricity generation; Electricity market; Electricity markets; Electricity system; Empirical evidence; Generation capacity; Qualitative behavior; Security of supply; Commerce; Computer simulation; Electric generators; Electricity; Power quality; Profitability; Deregulation; autocorrelation; commodity price; computer simulation; deregulation; electricity generation; electricity supply; hypothesis testing; profitability; Chile; England; United Kingdom","Alvarez-Ramirez, J., Escarela-Perez, R., Espinosa-Perez, G., Urrea, R., Dynamics of electricity market correlations (2009) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 388 (11), pp. 2173-2188; Arango, A., Castañeda, J., Larsen, E., (2011), p. 12. , Mothballing in power markets: an experimental study.

So far shortage and excess calculated in years still alternate cyclically. The problem of encouraging generation investment and fulfilling short-term and long-term resource adequacy has secured worldwide attention. Different markets have devised diametrically different solutions. The capacity adequacy solutions across the world are investigated and summarized into four categories. Based on an analysis of and comparison between the four categories, the roadmap for the development of the East China capacity market is proposed. Important suggestions are also given for the next round deregulation of the East China power industry. © 2011 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.","Capacity payment; Electricity exchange center;

This is examined for Latin America where state and marketing power sector planning, contract auctions to assure supply adequacy in an uncertain market environment, cross-border contracts, financing challenges for generation investments, and auctions of contracts to secure supply adequacy in the second stage of power sector reform are discussed. First, the state and market in power sector planning reform and state policies in Latin America are considered. Here, present concerns; the state-market relationship (the position of regulation, globalisation, internationalisation), and state market in the energy sector (correction and adjustments) are reviewed. Case studies for Argentina and Brazil are briefly outlined. The paper then examines contract auctions to assure supply adequacy in an uncertain energy environment that are being explored to face supplyproblems over recent years in the Chilean electricity market, taking into account the unexpected restrictions in natural gas transfers from Argentina. Also discussed are supply adequacy mechanisms and cross-border contracts in the Central American regional electricity market including firm transmission rights and financing challenges for generation investments. The final part of the paper discusses auctions of contracts and energy call options to ensure supply adequacy in the Brazilian power sector reform. Here, first stage of power sector reform, what went wrong, the second stage of reform and the move towards energy supply auctions, energy supply auctions so far and what's next in the challenges of environmental constraints and electricity-gas integration are reviewed. The reform being proposed to the electric regulatory framework for wholesale transactions in Peru is also reviewed. Considered are bids for the supply of electricity, and improvements to market design. It represents an effort to solve some problems with the electricity market, particularly the perception that investment in new generation resources is, or may be in the future, inadequate. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Capacity obligations and payments; Electric market; Energy markets; Energy sector planning; International trade; Natural gas industry; Power industry; Power sector deregulation; Regulation; Risk allocation; Spot market; Supply adequacy; System operation","Capacity obligations and payments; Electric markets; Energy markets; Energy sector planning; Power industry; Power sector deregulation; Regulation; Risk allocation; Spot market; Supply adequacy; System operation; Deregulation; Electric generators; Electric industry; Electricity; Energy resources; Gas industry; International trade; Natural gas; Investments","Energy Charter Treaty, , ISBN 90-5948-029-5, D/204/7850/5, Energy Charter Secretariat, Boulevard de la Woluwe 56, B1200 Brussels, Belgium; Rudnick, H., Energy risk in Latin America-the growing challenges (2005) IEE International Conference on Energy Trading and Risk Management, , 21-22 November 2005 City University London; Rudnick, H., Barroso, L.A., Skerk, C., Blanco, A., South American reform lessons-twenty years of restructuring and reform in Argentina Brazil and Chile (2005) IEEE Power Energy Mag., 3 (4), pp. 49-59; Rudnick, H., Risk responsibility for supply in deregulated electricity markets-the Chilean case (2003) IEEE PES 2003 General Meeting, , Toronto, July; Pereira, M.V., Barroso, L.A., Rosenblatt, J., Supply adequacy in the Brazilian power market (2004) Ftxt IEEE PES, , General Meeting, San Francisco, June 2004; Moreno, R., Energy supply auctions in Chile (2005) Workshop on Equilibrium Models in Wholesale Electricity Markets, , University of Chile, Santiago, Chile 10-11 November; (2005) International Seminar on Auctions in Electric Markets, , http://www2.ing.puc.cl/power/seminario/, Universidad Catolica de Chile, 15 November 2005 Santiago, Chile; Oren, S.S., Capacity payments and supply adequacy in competitive electricity markets (2000) VII Symposium of Specialists in Electric Operational and Expansion Planning, , Curitiba, Brazil May; Proceso de consolidación de los mercados mayoristas de electricidad en los países centroamericanos (2002) LC/MEX/L.547, , CEPAL, Noviembre; Karacsony, J., Ríos, Z.R., Tinoco, M., Allocation of transmission capacity in the Central America electricity market (2004) IEEE PES 04GM Proceedings, , Denver; Barroso, L.A., Bressane, J.M., Thomé, L.M., Junqueira, M., Camargo, I., Oliveira, G., Binato, S., Pereira, M.V., Transmission structure in Brazil: Organization, evaluation and trends (2004) Proceedings of the IEEE General Meeting, , Denver; Pereira, M., Campodónico, N., Kelman, R., Long-term hydro scheduling based on stochastic models (1998) Proceedings of EPSOM Conference, , Zurich; Krishna, V., (2002) Auction Theory, , Academic Press San Diego; Barroso, L.A., Flach, B., Kelman, R., Bezerra, B., Binato, S., Bressane, J.M., Pereira, M.V., Integrated gas-electricity adequacy planning in Brazil: Technical and economical aspects (2005) Proceedings of the IEEE PES 05 General Meeting, , San Francisco, June 2005; (2002) Making Competition Work in Electricity, , Hunt Wiley New York; Ruff, L.E., Competitive electricity markets: Why they are working and how to improve them (1999) NERA, , May; Pérez Arriaga, J.I., Sánchez De Tembleque, L.J., Pardo, M., (2005) La Gestión de la Demanda Eléctrica, , March; Kelman, R., Barroso, L.A., Pereira, M.V., Market power assessment and mitigation in hydrothermal systems (2000) IEEE Trans.

Large amounts of variable wind power on the system will increase market risks, with prices more volatile and load factors for conventional thermal plant lower and more uncertain. This extra market risk may discourage investment in generation capacity. Financial viability for thermal plant will be increasingly dependent on price spikes during periods of low wind. Increased price risk will also make investment in other forms of low-carbon generation (e.g. nuclear power) more challenging.A number of policies can reduce the extent to which generators are exposed to market risks and encourage investment. However, market risks play a fundamental role in shaping efficient investment and dispatch patterns in a liberalised market. Therefore, measures to improve price signals and market functioning (such as a stronger carbon price and developing more responsive demand) are desirable. However, the scale of the investment challenge and increased risk mean targeted measures to reduce (although not eliminate) risk exposure, such as capacity mechanisms and fixed price schemes, may have increasing merit. The challenge for policy is to strike the right balance between market and planned approaches. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity market reform; Investment; Wind power","Britain; Carbon price; Electricity market; Electricity sector; Financial viability; Fixed prices; Generation capacity; High winds; Investment incentives; Load factors; Low-carbon; Market risks; Nuclear power; Price risks; Price signals; Price spike; Responsive demand; Risk exposure; Thermal plants; Costs; Electric industry; Electricity; Investments; Risk management; Wind power; Commerce; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity industry; energy market; energy policy; investment; renewable resource; wind power; United Kingdom","Abbad, J., Electricity market participation of wind farms: the success story of the Spanish pragmatism (2010) Energy Policy, 38, pp. 3174-3179; Abbad, J., Electricity market participation of wind farms: the success story of the Spanish pragmatism, Energy Policy, in press; Adib, P., Schubert, E., Shmuel, O., Resource adequacy: alternate perspectives and divergent paths (2008) Competitive Electricity Markets, pp. 327-363. , Elsevier, Oxford, F.

This approach formulates the problem as a two-level decision. The upper problem models the expected future investments from all the companies over the lifetime of the investment plant that the company is evaluating. A 'prototype' schedule of future investments and retirements in the system is defined using dynamic programming (DP). The lower problem estimates the net revenues of the new investment plant against the 'prototype' investment schedule obtained in the upper problem. The expected revenue that the new plant derives from the energy market is calculated by clearing the market for several load levels every year, while the expected revenue from the capacity payment depend on the system's reserve capacity. A price duration curve from an actual market is used to estimate the bids that generators are likely to submit in an oligopoly market.","Capacity payment; Dynamic programming; Oligopoly electricity market; Power investment","Commerce; Competition; Dynamic programming; Economics; Electric industry; Power markets; Capacity payments; Expected revenue; Generating companies; Generation investment; Oligopoly market; Power investments; Price duration curve; Reserve capacity; Investments","Oren, S.S., Policy and economics (2003) Proceedings of the Conference on ""Ensuring Generation Adequacy in Competitive Electricity Markets"", , 3 June University of California Energy Institute; Sakellaris, K., The Greek capacity adequacy mechanism: Design, incentives, strategic behavior and regulatory remedies (2009) Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on European Energy Markets; Ortega-Vazquez, M.A., Kirschen, D.S., Assessment of generation expansion mechanisms using MultiAgent systems (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting; Vázquez, C., Rivier, M., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., A market approach to long-term security of supply (2002) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 17 (2), pp. 349-357; Doorman, G.L., Capacity subscription: Solving the peak demand challenge in electricity markets (2005) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 20 (1), pp. 239-245; Botterud, A., Korpas, M., A stochastic dynamic model for optimal timing of investments in new generation capacity in restructured power systems (2006) International Journal of Electrical Energy and Power Systems, 29, pp. 163-174; Dahlan, N.Y., Kirschen, D.S., Valuation model for generation investment in an oligopoly electricity market Proceedings of MedPower 2010; (2009) Real-Time Energy Market, , http://www.pjm.com; Maybee, J., Randolph, P., Uri, N., Optimal step function approximations to utility load duration curve (1979) Engineering Optimization, 4 (2), pp. 89-93; (2010), http://www.nationalgrid.com; Valenzuela, J., Mazumdar, M., A probability model for the electricity price duration curve under an oligopoly market (2005) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 20 (3), pp. 1250-1256. , Aug; Sullivan, W.G., Wick, E.M., Koelling, C.P., (2009) Engineering Economy, , 14th edition, Prentice Hall; Newbery, D., Pool reform and competition in electricity (1998) Regulating Utilities: Understanding the Issues, , M.

Investment decisions are fundamentally based on total revenues gained by investors. In most electricity markets, the complementary mechanisms are designed to ensure a desired level of reliability while covering investment costs of the suppliers. In such an environment, investment decisions are highly sensitive to expectation of price signals in both of energy market and capacity mechanisms. In this work, the system dynamics concepts are used to model the structural characteristics of electricity market such as, long-term firms' behavior and relationships between variables, feedbacks, and time delays by appropriately bundling the energy market and capacity mechanisms. The market oriented capacity price as well as non-competitive capacity payments and a proposed hybrid capacity mechanism are linked with the energy market in the model. Such a decision model enables both the generation companies and the regulators gaining perfect insights into the possible consequences of different decisions they make under different policies and market conditions. In order to examine the performance of the electricity market with different capacity mechanisms, a case study is presented which exhibits the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Capacity market; Capacity mechanisms; Capacity payment; Energy market; Investment decision; System dynamics","Commerce; Dynamics; Economics; Electric industry; Mathematical models; System theory; Capacity markets; Capacity mechanisms; Capacity payments; Energy markets; Investment decision; System Dynamics; Investments; complementarity; decision analysis; decision making; energy market; industrial competition; investment; market system; numerical model; performance assessment; systems analysis","Williams, J.H., Ghanadan, R., Electricity reform in developing and transition countries: a reappraisal (2006) Energy, 31 (6-7), pp. 815-844; Olsina, F., Garces, F., Haubrich, H.J., Modeling long-term dynamics of electricity markets (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (12), pp. 1411-1433; Dyner, I., Larsen, E.R., From planning to strategy in the electricity industry (2001) Energy Policy, 29 (13), pp. 1145-1154; Foley, A.M., A strategic review of electricity systems models (2010) Energy, 35 (12), pp. 4522-4530; Shahidehpour, M., Yamin, H., Li, Z., (2002) Market operations in electric power systems, , John Wiley & Sons; Bunn, D.W., Larsen, E.R., Sensitivity of reserve margin to factors influencing investment behavior in the electricity markets of England and Wales (1992) Energy Policy, 20 (5), pp. 420-429; Bunn, D.W., Larsen, E.R., Vlahos, K., Complementary modeling approaches for analyzing several effects of privatization on electricity investment (1993) Journal of Operational Research Society, 44 (10), pp. 957-971; Gary, S., Larsen, E.R., Improving firm performance in out-of-equilibrium deregulated markets using feedback simulation models (2000) Energy Policy, 28 (12), pp. 845-855; Ford, A., Cycles in competitive electricity markets: a simulation study of the Western US (1999) Energy Policy, 27 (11), pp. 637-658; Ford, A., Waiting for the boom: a simulation study of power plant construction in California (2001) Energy Policy, 29 (11), pp. 847-869; Botterud, A., Korpas, M., Vogstad, K., Wangensteen, I., A dynamic simulation model for long-term analysis of the power market (2002) 14th Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC), , Seville, Spain; Vogstad, K., Botterud, A., Maribu, K.M., Grenaa, S., (2002), The transition from a fossil fuelled towards a renewable power supply in a deregulated electricity market.

Flexibility limiting system components, which cause negative prices, are explained and illustrated for the German market. The decision of the European Energy Exchange in Leipzig to allow negative price bids is then explained. The empirical data illustrate the flexibility of conventional generating capacities in Germany from October 2008 to December 2009. Of the 86. h of negative spot prices, 19. h were significantly negative, with prices of at least -100. €/MWh. These extreme hours were analysed in greater detail by the examination of different system components. Thereby, load, wind power infeed and conventional generation by fuel type were observed, as well as the market for negative tertiary reserve, as indicators for market tightness. Although the market situations were found to be severe, under the current conditions, it could have been much worse. In order to enable the market to clear at all times, policy recommendations are provided and long-run implications of an increasing RES-E share on the conventional generation capacity are discussed. The article concludes with an outlook on additional power system flexibility options. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity markets; Negative prices; Wind power integration","Conventional generation; Electricity market; Empirical analysis; Empirical data; European energy exchanges; Extreme events; Fuel types; Generating capacity; German markets; Germany; Leipzig; Limiting system; Market situation; Negative prices; Power markets; Power systems; Renewable energy source; Spot price; System components; Wind power integration; Wind power integrations; Costs; Wind power; Commerce; alternative energy; electricity generation; electricity supply; empirical analysis; energy planning; energy policy; renewable resource; wind power; Germany","Batlle, C., Pérez-Arriaga, I., Design criteria for implementing a capacity mechanism in deregulated electricity markets (2008) Utilities Policy, 16 (3), pp. 184-193; Bode, S., Groscurth, H., (2006), pp. 1616-4814. , The effect of the German Renewable Energy Act (EEG) on ""the Electricity Price"".

The reason for this is that competitive energy-only markets struggle to be remunerative given reliability constraints and market price caps. Historically, Australia's 45,000. MW National Electricity Market has managed to navigate this well understood problem, albeit with government entities directly or indirectly responsible for a surprisingly large 73% of all new plant investments to 2007. But government involvement in direct investment has now ceased. So what will enable the industry to navigate the Resource Adequacy problem into the future? Quite simply, industrial organisation, the presence of merchant utilities with investment-grade credit ratings and setting any regulated retail prices or 'price to beat' with an LRMC floor. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity prices; Resource Adequacy; Vertical integration","Australia; Credit ratings; Direct investments; Electricity prices; Energy-only market; Government entities; Industrial organisation; Market price; National electricity markets; Plant investments; Reliability constraints; Resource adequacy; Retail price; Vertical integration; Commerce; Costs; Navigation; Rating; Investments; competitiveness; electricity industry; energy market; investment; price dynamics; resource assessment; vertical integration; Australia","(2007) APRA insight-10 years of superannuation data collection: 1996 to 2006, , APRA Publication, Sydney, APRA: Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority; Besser, J., Farr, J., Tierney, S., The political economy of long-term generation adequacy: why an ICAP mechanism is needed as part of standard market design (2002) Electricity Journal, 15 (7), pp. 53-62; Bidwell, M., Henney, A., (2004), Will Neta ensure generation adequacy?, Power UK, Issue 122, April 2004; Bushnell, J., California's electricity crisis: a market apart?

This matter is undoubtedly gaining importance and it has taken a key role in the energy regulators' agendas.In this paper, we critically review and categorize the different approaches regulators can opt for to deal with the problem of guaranteeing (or at least enhancing) security of supply in a market-oriented environment. We analyze the most relevant regulatory design elements throughout an updated assessment of the broad range of international experiences, highlighting the lessons we have learned so far in a variety of contexts. Based on the analysis, we conclude by providing a set of principles and criteria that should be considered by the regulator when designing a security of supply mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity market rules; Regulatory intervention; Security of supply","Critical assessment; Design elements; Electricity generation; Electricity market; International experiences; Power systems; Regulatory interventions; Regulatory mechanism; Security of supply; Commerce; Electric industry; Electric power generation; Electric generators; electrical power; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy market; regulatory approach","(2007), AER (Australian Energy Regulator) 2007.

The proposed planning approach gauges transmission congestion and security constraints with respect to transmission investments while promoting investments on independent power produces (IPPs) through incentive payments. The paper includes discussions on incentive mechanisms and prioritization among qualified IPPs for several planning scenarios. Such incentives might be necessary to trigger investments on IPPs earlier than those projected by the decentralized generation system, when the power system security is threatened. The proposed planning approach would optimize the sum of transmission investments, incentive payments to IPPs, and congestion costs along the planning horizon. The case studies illustrate how the proposed planning algorithm could be utilized in order to determine incentive payments to candidate generators when necessary, and prioritize such incentives among multiple IPP candidates. © 2010 IEEE.","Incentive payments; IPP investments; transmission congestion; transmission expansion planning; transmission security","Congestion costs; Decentralized generation; Grid planning; Incentive mechanism; Incentive payments; Investment decisions; Planning algorithms; Planning horizons; Power system security; Prioritization; Security constraint; Transmission congestion; Transmission expansion planning; Transmission investments; Transmission security; Expansion; Optimization; Pension plans; Planning; Traffic congestion; Investments","Baldick, R., Kahn, E., Transmission planning issues in a competitive economic environment (1993) IEEE Trans.

There are various research topics, so it is required to identify the different areas and scientific advances in the field. Setting the types of assumptions used in the models and the influence of dynamic variables such as generation, demand and flow control will allow a better understanding of market dynamics. A comprehensive literature review is performed and in a context of power markets the most recent and relevant research in the evolution of the transmission is assessed. The paper presents topics of economic regulation and market mechanisms, planning, financial assessment, assignment, network congestion, economic and technical modeling methods and the influence of transmission technologies in the energy market. Research has sought to provide coupling mechanisms between economic and technical concepts, in order to provide feasible solutions to the electricity market. The debate about which is the best mechanism for the regulation of transmission, the planning model and the allocation of transmission costs, are still in force. The new contributions are focused on the impact of transmission on the market and the social benefits of the proposed mechanisms for transmission expansion.The paper presents topics of economic regulation and market mechanisms, planning, financial assessment, assignment, network congestion, economic modeling techniques and technology and the influence of transmission technologies in the energy market.

In this study, the authors propose a locational capacity price (LCP) model along with multi-level load bidding curves, which reflect the effectiveness of the market-based capacity payment and at the same time, prohibits the capacity withholding and the exercising of market power. The purpose of capacity expansion decision is analysed and compared with three other market design options, that is, energy-only, capacity payment (CP) and installed capacity (ICAP). The case studies show that the proposed LCP method provides proper investment signals in capacity-constrained locations. The proposed LCP method also provides signals to system operators to alleviate transmission congestions economically using proper operation strategies in power systems. © 2010 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Bidding curve; Capacity adequacy; Capacity expansion; Capacity payments; Capacity withholding; Installed capacity; Market design; Market Power; Multi-level load; Operation strategy; Power systems; Restructured power systems; System operator; Transmission congestion; Transmission expansion; Automobile seats; Commerce; Electric power systems; Investments","Wang, X., Song, Y., Irving, M., Modern power system analysis (2009), Springer, New York; De Vries, L.J., Securing the public interest in electricity generation markets 2004, PhD, Technical University of Delft The Netherlands; Chao, H., Capacity markets in NYISO & ISO-NE (2007) IEEE PES General Meeting, pp. 1-4; Wang, J., Botterud, A., Conzelmann, G., Koritarov, V., Market power analysis in the EEX electricity market: an agent-based simulation approach (2008) IEEE PES General Meetings, pp. 1-8; Wang, J., Conjectural variation-based bidding strategies with Q-learning in electricity markets (2009) The 42nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS 2009), pp. 1-10; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense (2005) , Electr.

However, in response to concerns over the reasonableness of an investment signal in the energy-only electricity market, various designs of capacity mechanisms have been proposed to solve the adequacy problem. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the influence of capacity mechanisms on the long-term market equilibrium in the electricity market. Three market models are considered: a price-spike model, a capacity payment model, and a capacity demand curve model. The long-term market equilibrium in each market model is calculated through load duration, price duration, net revenue, and generation investment models. To consider the generation companies' investment behavior when the profit contains uncertainties, different utility functions representing their risk attitude is introduced. This paper presents the sensitivity of the risk components such as the change of the generation companies' risk attitude, the forced outage rate, the error of the forecasted peak load, and the load factor. The performance of each market model has been compared, which would come to the conclusion that when the electricity market does not have enough demand response and the ability to remove the abuse of market power, as transitional measures, it is necessary to adopt the capacity demand curve model even though it is not market-based approach and has the drawback that the performance depends on the shape of the capacity demand curve and market conditions.

However, large-scale connection of DG involves profound changes in the operation and planning of electricity distribution networks. Distribution System Operators (DSOs) play a key role since these agents have to provide flexibility to their networks in order to integrate DG. Article 14.7 of EU Electricity Directive states that DSOs should consider DG as an alternative to new network investments. This is a challenging task, particularly under the current regulatory framework where DSOs must be legally and functionally unbundled from other activities in the electricity sector. This paper proposes a market mechanism, referred to as reliability options for distributed generation (RODG), which provides DSOs with an alternative to the investment in new distribution facilities.

In a capacity-energy combined market environment, suppliers have incentives to deliberately over-offering their capacities in the capacity market while bid very high price in the energy and ancillary markets to avoid operation. This paper analyzes the risks and profits of this capacity-over-offering behavior, and develops a method for computing non-operable penalty level which can prevent the capacity-over-offering behavior. It is found that the effective penalty level is highly correlated with the stochastic characteristics of supplier's profit streams and supplier's risk attitudes. Two types of suppliers are suggested as the potential cheaters in the analysis. The methodology and the results are potentially useful for the operation and mitigation in a capacity-energy market environment.","Capacity market; Monte-Carlo simulation; Non-operable penalty; Over-offering; Prospect theory; Risk analysis",,"Vazquez, C., Rivier, M., Perez-Arriaga, I.J., A market approach to long-term security of supply (2002) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 17 (2), pp. 349-357. , DOI 10.1109/TPWRS.2002.1007903, PII S0885895002038348; Harvey, S.M., ICAP systems in the Northeast: Trends and lessons (2005) LECG, Report. to the California ISO, , September; Roques, F.A., Newbery, D.M., Nuttall, W.J., Investment incentives and electricity market design: The British experience (2005) Review of Network Economics, Review of Network Economics, 4 (2), pp. 93-128. , June; Joskow, P.L., (2005) Supply Security in Competitive Electricity and Natural Gas Markets, , 29 December, 2005; Coutu, R., Migrating from long-term resource planning to market-based solutions IEEE PES GM2005; Singh, H., Resource adequacy and capacity markets IEEE PES GM2005; Bekman, K., The conflict between resource adequacy and electricity markets IEEE PES GM2005; King, C.A., The evolution of capacity markets at the NYISO IEEE PES GM2005; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense IEEE PES GM2005; Trehan, N.K., Long-term resource adequacy - Supply resources IEEE PES PSCE2004; Bergeron, D., (2001) Resource Adequacy in Competitive Markets: A Regulator's Perspective, , IEEE; Oren, S.S., Market-friendly generation adequacy assurance (2005) PUCT Workshop on Generation Adequacy, , resented at the, Austin Texas, April 20; Chao, H.-P., Wilson, R., Resource adequacy and market power mitigation via option contracts (2004) EPRI Report; Oren, S., Smith, S., Wilson, R., Capacity pricing (1985) Econometrica, 53 (3), pp. 545-566. , may; Oren, S., Capacity payments and supply adequacy in a competitive electricity market (2000) VII SEPOPE, , Curitiba-Parana Brazil, May 21-26; (2003) Central Resource Adequacy Markets for PJM, NY-ISO and NE-ISO, Final Report, , Prepared by NERA, February; Reed, H.J., (2004) Resource Adequacy, , EEI : Alliance of Energy Suppliers, Energy Supply EAC, January 14; Resource/Supply Adequacy, MidWest ISO, HEPG, September 22, 2005; Karl, M., Ibrahim, A., (2003) Resource Adequacy Market Model, , Power System Resource Adequacy Working Group, NEISO, November 5th; (2006) A Resource Adequacy Standard for the Pacific Northwest, , Northwest Power and Conservation Council, Feb. 22; Bushnell, J., (2005) Electricity Resource Adequacy: Matching Policies and Goals, , UCEI and Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, August; Fu, S., Bai, X., Wang, H., Resource adequacy problems in China and proposed solutions (2005) IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exhibition Asia Pacific; http://www.nyiso.com/public/products/icap/index.jsp, for NYISO Capacity Market; http://www.isone.com/markets/othrmkts-data/fcm/index.html, for ISO-NE Capacity Market; http://www.pjm.com/markets/rpm/rpm.html, for PJM Capacity Market; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense (2005) IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, , San Francisco, CA, USA, June; Hobbs, B.F., Hu, M.C., Iñón, J.G., Stoft, S.E., Bhavaraju, M.P., A dynamic analysis of a demand curve-based capacity market proposal: The PJM reliability pricing model (2007) IEEE Trans.

The aim is to reconcile generation adequacy with efficient energy purchase, correct risk allocation among investors and consumers, and the politico-economic environment of the country. In this paper, a generic proposal for a long-term electricity contracts approach is made, including practical design concepts for implementation. This proposal is empirically derived from the auctions implemented in Brazil and Chile during the last 6 years. The study is focused on practices and lessons which are especially useful for regulators and policy makers that want to facilitate the financing of new desirable power plants in risky environments and also efficiently allocate supply contracts among investors at competitive prices. Although this mechanism is generally seen as a significant improvement in market regulation, there are questions and concerns on auction performance that require careful design and which are identified in this paper. In addition, the experiences and proposal described can serve to derive further mechanisms in order to promote the entrance of particular generation technologies, e.g. renewables, in the developed world and therefore achieve a clean electricity supply. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we investigate the efficiency properties of a ""forward capacity market"" (FCM), using the methods of experimental economics. Our contribution is in the modeling and experimentation of such a market design. Our results from laboratory experiments show that capacity markets give better private incentives to invest in new capacities that energy-only markets.

International experiences have shown that it is difficult that the market alone provides incentives to attract enough investment in capacity reserves. We analyze various measures to cope with this problem, including moth-ball reserves, capacity payments, ICAP and call options. We then construct a model to analyze the structure of incentives for the expansion of electricity supply in the spot market, and capacity in the long run electricity reserve market. Through a game-theory model, we analyze price convergence in three markets: the peak spot market, the non-peak spot market, and the long-run capacity reserve market. We finally carry out a simulation for Mexican power generation. The combination of CFE'S virtual market, together with capacity payments, has eventually resulted in capacity generation expansion similar to what would be attained in an open electricity market, such as the one modelled in our study.

This paper builds a dynamic simulation model to solve the setting of two key parameters, the energy price cap and the capacity price in the generation market, and applies this model to various cases to analyze the generation capacity development. Based on the simulation results, this paper analyzes the sensitivity of generation capacity to the key parameters. Furthermore, this paper proposes an evaluation index system for the simulation model, and discusses the correlation between the two key parameters, from the views of reliability and economy. The research shows that there might be potential unmarked misunderstandings in the setting of key parameters, and suggests that under a certain electricity bill for customers, parameter combination of low energy price cap and high capacity price should be made, in order to curb the fluctuation of generation capacity and maintain the system reliability. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Computer simulation; Costs; Economics; Electric power generation; Investments; Paper; Quality assurance; Reliability; Risk analysis; Risk management; Dynamic simulation models; Electricity bills; Electricity supplies; Energy prices; Evaluation index systems; Generation adequacies; Generation capacities; Generation markets; High capacities; Key parameters; Low energies; ON dynamics; Parameter combinations; Simulation models; Simulation results; System reliabilities; Electric generators","Oren, S.S., Capacity Payments and Supply Adequacy in Competitive Electricity Markets (2000) Proc. of the VII Symposium of Specialists in Electric Operational and Expansion Planning, , Brazil; de Vries, L.J., Hakvoort, R.A., The question of generation adequacy in liberalized electricity markets (2003) Proc. of the 26th IAEE International Conference, , Prague, Czech Republic; Creti, A., Fabra, N., Capacity Markets for Electricity, , unpublished; Fraser, H., Lo Passo, F., Developing a Capacity Payment Mechanism in Italy (2003) The Electricity Journal, 16 (9), pp. 54-58; Borenstein, S., The trouble with electricity markets: Understanding California's restructuring disaster (2002) Journal of Economic perspectives, 16 (1), pp. 191-211; Hobbs, B.F., Inon, J., Stoft, S.E., Installed capacity requirements and price caps: Oil on the water, or fuel on the fire?

Two investment incentive mechanisms - Capacity obligations and Reliability contracts - are analyzed and compared to the benchmark design, the energy-only market. We use the dynamic programming method and real option theory to develop two dynamic models that enable one to assess the optimal market design for ensuring sufficient generation capacity to meet future demand at efficient cost (the deterministic model) and to analyze the optimal timing of investments when uncertainties in future load and fuel prices are considered (the stochastic model). The effects of different factors on investment strategies, such as the pricing of CO2 and differences between construction delays and cost structures of the new technologies, are also analyzed. The numerical results show that: (1) the reliability contract scheme would be the more cost-efficient mechanism, ensuring the long term system adequacy and encouraging earlier and adequate new investments in the system, compared to the capacity obligation method which would result in overinvestment and price manipulations; (2) short lead time technology would be preferred with the capacity obligation design, while cost competitive technology would be chosen with the reliability contract scheme; (3) the pricing of CO2 and the taking into account of uncertainties would affect investment strategies but would have no impact on the effectiveness of the reliability contracts scheme.","Dynamic programming; Electricity markets; Generation capacity adequacy; Real options",,"Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., Long-term reliability of generation in competitive wholesale markets; A critical review of issues and alternative options (2001) IIT Working Paper IIT -00-098IT, , June; Oren, S.S., Capacity payments and supply adequacy in competitive electricity markets (2000) VII Symposium of Specialists in Electric Operational and Expansion Planning, , CURITIBA-BRESIL May; Chuang, A.S., Wu, F., Capacity payments and the pricing of reliability in competitive generation markets Proceeding of the 33rd Hawai International Conference on System Sciences-2000; Doorman, L., Capacity subscription and security of supply in deregulated electricity markets"" (2003) SINTEF Energy Research N-7465 Trondheim, , Norway August; Ford, A., Cycles in competitive electricity markets: A simulation study of the western United States (1999) Energy Policy, , August; Mo, B., Hegge, J., Wangensteen, I., Stochastic generation expansion planning by means of stochastic dynamic programming (1991) IEEE Transaction in Power Systems, 6 (2). , May; Dentcheva, D., Römisch, W., Optimal Power Generation under Uncertainty via Stochastic Programming, , Humboldt-University Berlin.

Based on the system dynamics theory, this paper builds up a model that describes the development of electric power generation investment, and uses the model to perform the dynamic simulation of generation capacity investment in different market scenarios, such as the energy-only market and the capacity payment mechanism. Particularly, imperfections of the real world are taken into consideration, which is reflected by the accuracy of load forecast. The simulation shows that generation investment would fluctuate due to the volatility of price and imperfection of information, even if the average revenue recovers the investment cost of the optimal installation, and thus result in shortage of supply in the market. Furthermore, suitable capacity mechanisms help reduce the possibility of shortage, but may trigger overinvestment in generation capacity and remain the fluctuation that threatens the reliability of power supply service. ©2008 IEEE.","Capacity payment mechanism; Energy-only market; Generation investment; System dynamics","Computer simulation; Dynamics; Economics; Electric load forecasting; Electric power distribution; Electric power generation; Electric power measurement; Electric power systems; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Human computer interaction; Investments; Marketing; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Supply chains; Capacity payment mechanism; Dynamic simulations; Electric power supplies; Energy-only market; Generation capacities; Generation investment; Investment costs; Load forecasts; Market scenarios; Mechanism analyses; ON dynamics; Overinvestment; Real worlds; Reliability of power supplies; Significant impacts; System dynamics; Electric generators","Creti, A., Fabra, N., Capacity Markets for Electricity unpublished; Bidwell, M., Henney, A., Will Neta ensure generation adequacy?

It presents the evolution of installed capacity markets in the United States. It proposes market alternatives to capacity mechanisms. It also discusses energy-only resource adequacy mechanisms with a focus on the experience in Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). It presents a potential transitional mechanism based on energy-only markets with contracting obligations. It reveals a selected historical account of resource adequacy mechanisms throughout the world with a focus on developments in the United States, where the capacity framework has been going through substantial evolution and policy debate in multiple markets under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction for almost 10 years. It also examines the reconfirmation of an energy-only framework adopted in ERCOT, in part because of the concern that the evolving capacity framework in other US markets was not consistent with ERCOT's deregulated wholesale and retail markets. It shows that the slow and incomplete transformation of wholesale electricity markets have limited the options that policymakers have had available in creating sustainable resource adequacy mechanisms in the United States. Capacity mechanisms in the United States have evolved in part to overcome shortcomings in transmission construction, lack of adequate demand response programs, and policies that restrict the ability of new generation to interconnect with the transmission grid. The authors contend that these shortcomings are a direct consequence of the fragmented oversight of electricity markets in the United States. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,,"(2005) Refinement Options for Alberta's Wholesale and Retail Electric Markets, , Alberta Department of Energy, Alberta, canada, 10 March; Barroso, L.A., Rudnick, H., Hammons, T., Second wave of electricity market reforms in Latin America (2006) Presented at IEEE PES Panel Session, IEEE General Meeting; Bezerra, B., Augusto Barroso, L., Granville, S., Energy call options auctions for generation adequacy in Brazil (2006) Proceedings of the IEEE Annual Meeting; Boiteaux, M., Peak load pricing (1960) J. of Bus., 33, pp. 157-179; (2004) A Transitional Non-LMP Market for California: Issues and Recommendations, , Charles Rivers and Associates [Ruff, Larry]; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense (2005) Elec.

However, while the energy-only NEM has served Australia well since 1998, deep structural supply-side faults exist. Competitive energy-only markets do not have a stable equilibrium solution unless reliability constraints are violated, market power is exercised, or scarcity pricing operates unabated. But the political economy of electricity means none of this is likely. This research finds that by reducing the NEM price cap and introducing a 'capacity payments pool', a tractable and politically acceptable equilibrium can be established to facilitate timely plant entry. © 2008 The University of Melbourne, Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.",,"electricity industry; electricity supply; energy market; industrial competition; political economy; price dynamics; Australasia; Australia","Anderson, E., Hu, X., Winchester, D., Forward contracts in electricity markets: The Australian experience (2007) Energy Policy, 35, pp. 3089-3103; Barker, D., (2004) 'Long Term Resource Adequacy: Capacity Market Mechanisms and Their Impact On Generation Investment', , Rossi Inc paper prepared for the Southern Generator Group (La Trobe Valley, Australia), Toronto; Berrie, T.W., The economics of system planning in bulk electricity supply: Development of generating plant mix (1967) Electrical Review, 22, pp. 425-428. , September; Besser, J., Farr, J., Tierney, S., The political economy of long-term generation adequacy: Why an ICAP mechanism is needed as part of standard market design (2002) Electricity Journal, 15, pp. 53-62; Bidwell, M., Reliability options: A market-orientated approach to long-term adequacy (2005) Electricity Journal, 18, pp. 11-25; Bidwell, M., Henney, A., 'Will NETA ensure generation adequacy?'

Then, theoretical advantages and disadvantages, as well as the practical feasibility, the application scope and supporting measures of these methods are clarified. Finally, based on the above analysis and research, some preliminary suggestions are made for ensuring generation capacity adequacy in China.","Capacity obligations and installed capacity market; Capacity payments; Capacity subscription; Generation capacity adequacy; Locational installed capacity market; Operating reserve payments; Options; Similar traditional planning","Clarification; Capacity obligations and installed capacity market; Capacity payments; Capacity subscription; Generation capacity adequacy; Locational installed capacity market; Operating reserve payments; Options; Similar traditional planning; Marketing","Perez-Arriaga, L.J., Long-term reliability of generation in competitive wholesale markets: A critical review of issues and alternative options (2006), http://www.iit.upcomillas.es/docs/01JIPA2001.pdf; Cramton, P., Stoft, S., A capacity market that makes sense (2005) The Electricity Journal, 18 (7), pp. 43-54; Jaffe, A.B., Felder, F.A., Should electricity markets have a capacity requirement?

These policy instruments differ in terms of objectives and final impacts on the price of electricity. We examine the effect of these policy instruments in the electricity sector, focusing on electricity producers and suppliers in a competitive market. Using microeconomic theory, we identify synergies between market players and demonstrate the total effect on the electricity price when suppliers internalize the behaviour of producers in their decisions. This model refers to an ideal market situation of full liberalization. The cases we examine consist of electricity producers with and without a carbon tax, electricity suppliers with and without an electricity tax, and with WhC obligations. Furthermore, we present a parallel implementation of WhC for electricity suppliers with carbon tax on electricity producers and an electricity tax with WhC obligations to electricity suppliers. We demonstrate differences in optimization behaviour of producers and suppliers. Based on a couple of cases of WhC with carbon and electricity taxes, various positive and negative effects of both schemes in terms of target achievement and efficiency are present, which can lead to an added value of such schemes in the policy mix, although uncertainties of outcomes are quite high. A basic finding is that in a merit order several parameters can increase final electricity price after the implementation of different policies: demand for electricity and electricity supply cost at a large scale and then follow the level of level of obligation for energy saving, level of penalty, and price of WhC (representing the marginal costs of energy saving projects). The impact magnitude of parameters depends on the values chosen and on the initial position of suppliers (i.e. if their actual behaviour deviates from full compliance with targets). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, determining reserve requirements based on probabilistic approaches results in more economical efficiency, while maintaining an acceptable level of reliability, compared to deterministic approaches. This paper proposes a new method for clearing energy and spinning reserve markets simultaneously, while at the same time, spinning reserve requirements are determined based on a cost/benefit analysis as a probabilistic-based approach. This cost/benefit analysis considers both the costs of providing extra reliability and the benefits of fewer customer interruptions to the society.

If there is a lack of investment, the priority should be to identify the roots of the problem. The lack of demand-side response, short-term reliability management procedures and non-market ancillary services provision often undermine market reflective scarcity pricing and distort long-term investment incentives. The introduction of a capacity mechanism should come as an optional supplement to wholesale and ancillary markets improvements. Priority reforms should focus on encouraging demand-side responsiveness and reducing scarcity price distortions introduced by balancing and congestion management through better dialog between network engineers and market operators. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Markets for electricity generation appear to be prone to an investment cycle due to their capital-intensiveness and the long lead time of new generation facilities. We tested the stability of different capacity mechanisms in the presence of uncertainty regarding the demand growth rate with a stochastic dynamic model. Investment decisions were assumed to maximize profit, based on an assumed growth rate of demand that was equal to the rolling average of the previous five years. All capacity mechanisms proved effective in reducing the tendency towards an investment cycle, but to different degrees. Interestingly, an oligopoly that is able to raise average prices by 10% would also be able to substantially reduce price volatility and decrease the risk of shortages by increasing the reserve margin. Benefits of such a strategy for the generating companies could be that it would deter new market entrants and stave off the political attention that shortages and price spikes would bring about. However, the benefits to consumers are compromised by the lack of economic efficiency and distributional effects of an oligopoly, while the stability of such an oligopolistic strategy can be questioned. The most attractive solution is a system of reliability contracts, which can be used to stabilize both investment and prices, while reducing market power and providing more efficient operational incentives to generating companies. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of capacity adequacy in power supply, which could be considered as a collective good, two solutions of supply by government can be envisaged: a long-term capacity reserve contracting by the system operator (SO), and a direct installation of peaking units by the SO. However, the centralised and direct mechanisms are criticised, because of its potential to distort incentives to invest in peaking units and hence the natural functioning of energy markets. This paper analyses the different characters of a simple capacity mechanism and the safeguards used to limit its potential distortion effects. We discuss its deterrent effects on investment in peaking units. We also demonstrate its advantage in the context of hydro or mixed electricity systems exposed to the risk of exceptionally dry years. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Market prices and contractual arrangements on the physical and financial electricity markets do not allow the creation of sufficient incentives to invest in adequate capacity for guaranteeing the appropriate level of supply in every circumstance. Long-term security of supply by capacity adequacy must be conceptualised as a public good. Alternative solutions to reach capacity adequacy having been adopted in different markets are successively considered: public procurement of strategic reserves, capacity payments, capacity obligations with tradable rights. Each presents theoretical limits and practical drawbacks when implemented in complex markets. That brings out the interest of a mechanism of centralised auctions for forward capacity contracts (or reliability options); it combines controls by quantity and by price while stabilising investment in peak power plants and is compatible with energy and reserves markets, which is not the case with the three other mechanisms. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Capacity payments and capacity markets have been investigated for this purpose. Latin American markets are exploring energy supply auctions, an avenue that is assessed in this paper. Auction mechanisms are studied through auction theory by using Bayesian equilibrium concepts. Two sealed bid auction formats are reviewed: a single object first-price auction and single object second-price auction. These formats are analyzed under a pseudo common value and symmetric equilibrium framework. In order to solve the first order conditions of the programming models and to compute the price market, numerical and sampling methods are used as Monte Carlo heuristics. The developed models are applied to assess future auctions in the Chilean electricity market.","Auction theory; Auctions; Electricity market; Investment; Supply contracts","Computation theory; Costs; Deregulation; Electric industry; Heuristic methods; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Numerical methods; Power markets; Auction theory; Auctions; Bayesian equilibrium; Deregulated electricity market; First-order conditions; Generation investment; Supply contracts; Symmetric equilibrium; Commerce","Rudnick, H., Barroso, L.A., Skerk, C., Blanco, A., South American reform lessons - Twenty years of restructuring and reform in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile (2005) IEEE Power & Energy Magazine, 3 (4), pp. 49-59. , July-Aug. 2005; Krishna, V., (2002) Auction Theory, , Academic Press, San Diego, California; Riley, J.Y., Samuelson, W., Optimal auctions (1981) American Economic Review, 71, pp. 381-392; Kemplerer, P., Auction theory: A guide to the literature (1999) Journal of Economic Surveys, 13 (3), pp. 227-286; Vickrey, W., Counterspeculation, auction and competitive sealed tenders (1961) Journal of Finance, 16, pp. 8-37; Harsanyi, J., Games with incomplete information played by Bayesian players (1967) Management Science, 14, pp. 159-182. , 320-334, 486-502; Bampton, H., (1994) Solving Imperfect Information Games Using the Monte Carlo Heuristic, , Master of Science Thesis, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Holenstein, R., (2005) Using Sampling to Compute Bayes-Nash Equilibrium in Auction Games, , CPSC 532A Course Project, Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver; Cai, G.Y., Wurman, P., Monte Carlo approximation in incomplete information, sequential auction games (2005) Decision Support System, 39, pp. 153-168; Pereira, M.V., Barroso, L.A., Rosenblatt, J., Supply adequacy in the Brazilian power market (2004) IEEE PES 2004 General Meeting, , San Francisco, June 2004; Barroso, L., Rudnick, H., Moreno, R., Bezerra, B., (2007) Ensuring Resource Adequacy with Auctions of Options and Forward Contracts, , IEEE Power Engineering Society 2007 General Meeting, Tampa, Florida, June; Newbery, D., Competition, contracts, and entry in the electricity spot market (1998) Rand Journal of Economics, 29 (4). , Winter 1998",,,"Power Systems Computation Conference ( PSCC )",,9780947649289,,,"English","Power Syst.

The risks are all the more significant since the profitability of peak-load capacities is especially sensitive to the level of prices that are realised during the small number of hours in which they produce energy. But, the difficulty to balance between scarcity rents and abuses of market power could induce regulatory interventions as too stringent price-caps. These ones could make worse the spontaneous market under-investment. They restrict the scarcity rents expected by the investors and reinforce the law uncertainty. Our purpose is to analyse the mechanisms which are used to provide an optimal level of generating capacity, as capacity obligations, payments or markets, and to underline the complementarities between decentralised investment decisions and public action.

The restructuring process in Korea allocated power generation to six firms, competing within a wholesale market, albeit strictly on a cost basis. Because of this cost-based pool, capacity payments were also introduced to encourage new investment. However, it is an open question whether the current fixed capacity payment scheme is enough to secure resource adequacy, and consideration is being given to alternative mechanisms such as the use of LOLP. Using a detailed market simulation model, based on system dynamics, we compare these approaches in terms of how they may influence the investors' decisions and thereby determine the system reserve margin. The simulation results suggest that there may be serious problems in staying with the current fixed capacity payments in order to achieve resource adequacy. In contrast, an LOLP-based capacity mechanism may, in the longer term, increase the reserve margin compared with a fixed capacity payment. More generally, this paper indicates how crucial the effective modeling of the investment behavior of the independent power producers is for adequate policy support, even if they only constitute a fringe in a substantially centrally influenced market. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the model is a holistic simulation of generation and transmission capacity expansion in the market environment. The solution represents an iterative process for simulating the interactions among GENCOs, TRANSCOs, and the ISO, which might be terminated by the ISO based on a pre-specified stopping criterion. The proposed model adopts a joint energy and transmission auction market and a capacity mechanism. The joint auction market enables competition to occur among generation and transmission resources. The capacity mechanism offers incentives for market participant investments that reflect the locational values of additional capacity. Transmission capacity expansion decisions are made by merchant transmission lines that recover their capacity investments through transmission marginal pricing and capacity payments. Transmission network security is reflected in the proposed competitive resource planning model. The examples illustrate a coordinated planning of generation and transmission in restructured power systems. © 2007 IEEE.","Benders decomposition; Capacity planning; Competitive electricity markets; Decision support systems; Electricity supply industry; Generation capacity planning; Lagrangian field theory; Lagrangian relaxation; Merchant transmission; Mixed integer programming; Network security; Power generation; Transmission network security; Transmission planning","Competition; Costs; Decision support systems; Electric lines; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Integer programming; Investments; Transmission network calculations; Lagrangian field theory; Lagrangian relaxation; Transmission capacity expansion decisions; Electric industry","Shahidehpour, M., Investing in expansion: The many issues that cloud transmission planning (2004) IEEE Power Energy Mag, 2 (1), pp. 14-18. , Jan./Feb; Li, W., Billinton, R., A minimum cost assessment method for composite generation and transmission system expansion planning (1993) IEEE Trans.

In theory, in a perfectly competitive market, electricity prices should provide sufficient economic signals to market players so that they are incentivized enough both to keep in service power plants that work only during few peak hours and to invest in new generation capacity when necessary. In practice, due to several reasons (""political"" unsustainability of high prices, investors' risk aversion, uncertainties for new investments due to possible litigations with local communities, short term demand inelasticity, informative asymmetries, etc.), real markets need specific mechanisms (capacity payments) aimed at explicitly remunerating generation capacity, in order to ensure its adequacy over time and to avoid both high electricity price volatility and so-called ""boom-and-bust"" investment cycles, where periods with low reserve margins and high prices alternate to periods with excess of generation capacity and low prices. Different mechanisms have been applied worldwide, ranging from fixed payments administratively defined, such as in Spain, to specific uplifts to power pool prices, proportional to the loss of load probability and to the value of lost load, such as in the old England & Wales electricity market, to the ""capacity obligation"" markets of the PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland), New York and New England electricity markets, where load serving entities are obliged to buy from producers an amount of generation capacity sufficient to meet their load plus a pre-defined reserve margin. As far as the Italian electricity market is concerned, a specific decree (n. 379/03) of the Ministry of Productive Activities introduced a temporary capacity payment scheme and established the main criteria for a new final one, to be defined by the Italian Electric Energy and Gas Regulatory Authority. Such criteria foresee that the new scheme: • is based on competitive, transparent, non-discriminatory and non-distortive mechanisms, aimed at minimizing the economic impact on consumers; • is aimed both at remunerating newly built generating units and to keep in efficient service the existing ones; • is aimed at remunerating also consumers equipped with devices that make them able to provide the reserve service; • is based on capacity targets defined by the Italian TSO. The temporary capacity payment scheme is actually in force (end of 2005) and the Regulatory Authority devised a proposal for the new scheme. Within this context, aim of this paper is to describe the two aforementioned Italian capacity payment schemes and report the results of an analysis of the impact of the second one. The analysis has been carried out using an electricity market simulator able to model the electric system evolution, the investment dynamics and the related electricity prices over a long-term time horizon. To this aim, the simulator features a short-term cycle, where competition on electricity prices and quantities traded either on the power exchange or bilaterally is modeled, nested inside a long-term cycle, where competition on investments in new generation capacity is simulated. The simulator has been specifically tailored in order to model the capacity payment scheme to be evaluated.","Capacity payment; Long-term electricity market simulation; Resource adequacy","Capacity payments; Electricity market simulation; Electricity market simulators; Electricity price volatilities; Liberalized electricity market; New generation capacity; Resource adequacy; Structural capabilities; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Electric industry; Electricity; Energy management; Investments; Loss of load probability; Simulators; Electric generators","Ford, A., Cycles in competitive electricity markets: A simulation study of the western United States (1999) Energy Policy, 27, pp. 637-658. , 2; Vishudhiphan, P., Skantze, P., Ilic, M., Dynamic investment in electricity markets and its impact on system reliability (2001) Proc. of the Market Design 2001 Conference, , Stockholm, 7-8 June; Cremonesi, F., Gelmini, A., Martini, R., Simulatore di lungo termine per il mercato elettrico, SPEME, descrizione funzionale, manuale d'uso e simulazioni di scenari per il mercato elettrico italiano (2004) Report RdS A4524967, , www.ricercadisistema.it, (in Italian), December, available on; Gonzalez, J.L.F., Morales, G.G., Analysis of long term supply guarantee in the spanish power system, capacity payment and alternatives (1999) Power Delivery Conference, , Madrid; Shuttleworth, G., Electricity markets and capacity obligations (2002) A Report for the Department of Trade and Industry, , National Economic Research Associates, London; Vazquez, C., Rivier, M., Pérez-Arriaga, I.J., A market approach to long-term security supply (2002) IEEE Transactions on Power System, 17 (2). , May","Gelmini, A.; CESIItaly; email: gelmini@cesi.it",,,,,,,"English","Int.

This presentation criticises first the optimistic approach of the theory of investment incentives through market signals when it is applied to deregulated electricity industries. The greater part of the investment in base-load and peak equipment should be made profitable by income from very high prices during peak and extreme peak periods, that raises a problem of political acceptability. The problem is then addressed in the context of the mature electricity industries in the North. Given the maturity of markets there, a number of modifications to the pure market model could be envisaged to strengthen incentives to invest, but none of them is perfect. The main way is to focus on adaptation of market rules on the supply of power at peaks and extreme peaks by considering ""capacity adequacy"" as a public good (with three solutions: capacity payment, reserve obligations, centralised procurement by auctioning for peak capacity). Observation of reforms suggests also the validity of some other solutions based on a limitation of the competition by allowing long-term contracts and vertical integration between production and supply. Finally the question is extended to the specific problem of developing countries characterised by irregular growth. It is argued that reforms must be designed in view of the importance of the need for investment through long-term coordination and reduction of investment risks. Indeed experiences of Latin American liberalised industries show that they have to include a number of competition-based imperfections and to allow ongoing exercise of market power in order to allow prices to rise above competition prices. The single buyer model or some variants of it appear to be good alternatives if one wishes to avoid the twists and turns of the competition paradigm. The difficulty with this model arises from the institutional conditions necessary to make it efficient and not overcostly. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The early English capacity compensation payment is long-term reliability capacity value compensation, but it is not included in the spot energy market, so it is necessary to be compensated. However, the p-EVE pricing method provides an automatic capacity value compensation for the scale of economy besides the reliability capacity value. In order to compare the impacts between the early England market rule and the p-EVE pricing method, an agent-based simulation model that the generation suppliers execute the withholding capacity bidding strategy in oligarchic market is developed. The results show that in the early England market, there is large space for the generators to withhold capacity to result in the bidding capacity deficient and market price spike, and the more generation capacity deficient, the more market power to execute. The investigations also show that the cause for the suppliers to withhold capacity is result from the uniform clearing pricing methods in the energy market rather than the capacity compensation rule; On the other hand, if the spot energy market employing the p-EVE pricing method, there is less space for the suppliers to withhold capacity to lead to the enough bidding capacity and hold the market price steady. At last the conclusion is made that in oligarchic market, the early England market which employ the uniform clearing pricing method cannot provide the robust and efficient market characteristic, while the p-EVE pricing method cannot only give the generation suppliers adequate return of the capacity investment, but also provide the robust and efficient market characteristic.","Agent-based simulation; Capacity payment; Cournot game; Electricity market; Power systems; Probabilistic production simulation","Computer simulation; Electric power systems; Game theory; Investments; Agent based simulation; Capacity payment; Cournot game; Electricity market; Probabilistic production simulation; Uniform clearing pricing methods; Electric industry","Yan, M.-S., Electricity value equivalent (EVE).

Factors affecting investment vary from these times reduce in capital flows following the Asian crisis, to poor incentives for generation investment in market design. The difficulty, at least in Latin America, to operate energy-only markets without disruptive prince interventions or market power abuse, has made generation investment a challenge. Markets equipped with variations of capacity payments have performed better with concerns of inefficient investment and high final prices for consumers. The recognition that long-term contracting mechanisms and demand participation in handling supply risk are key to supply adequacy has lead to a new generation of market designs. The paper presents some of the challenges for financing generation in this new type of market designs from development banks perspective, and shows empirical evidence on what has been the investment practices in some selected countries in Latin America, spot market risk and also outside-of the energy market risk factors have play an important role, in order to diminish these risk investors often look for more comfortable traditional long-term contracts in opposition to newly market design paradigms which brings concerns on their effectiveness in developing countries if other institutional and regulatory factors are not in place. © 2006 IEEE.","Financing generation investments; Power market design; Power system economics; Supply adequacy","Economic analysis; Investments; Marketing; Power generation; Financing generation investments; Power market design; Power system economics; Electric power systems","Woodhouse, E.J., (2005) Infrastructure Contracting: Lessons from the IPP Experience, , Working Paper, Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at Stanford University, September 30; Oren, S., (2005) Generation Adequacy via Call Options Obligations: Safe Passage to the Promised Land, , University of California Energy Institute, University of California, Berkeley, September; Wolak, F.A., (2005) Proposal for Determining and Assigning the Reliability Charge for the Wholesale Energy Market, , Department of Economics Stanford University.

Uncontrolled exposure to market price risks can lead to devastating consequences for market participants in the restructured electricity industry. Lessons learned from the financial markets suggest that financial derivatives, when well understood and properly utilized, are beneficial to the sharing and controlling of undesired risks through properly structured hedging strategies. We review different types of electricity financial instruments and the general methodology for utilizing and pricing such instruments. In particular, we highlight the roles of these electricity derivatives in mitigating market risks and structuring hedging strategies for generators, load serving entities, and power marketers in various risk management applications. Finally, we conclude by pointing out the existing challenges in current electricity markets for increasing the breadth, liquidity and use of electricity derivatives for achieving economic efficiency. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Provided that the load growth uncertainty is assumed to be the major source of uncertainty, a new methodological framework for generation investment decision-making is presented based on the well-developed real option approach (ROA), with competition for generation investment from other investors taken into account. A mathematical model is developed and a solving approach is presented for this purpose. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated by a numerical example, and the effects of different market mechanisms on generation investment incentives and hence the generation capacity adequacy are also investigated in a quantitative way.","Capacity payment; Electricity market; Energy-only market; Generation capacity adequacy; Installed capacity market; Real option","Electric industry; Mathematical models; Risk assessment; Capacity payment; Electricity market; Energy only market; Generation capacity adequacy; Installed capacity market; Real option; Electric power systems","Dixit, A.K., Pindyck, R.S., (1994) Investment Under Uncertainty, , Princeton (NJ, USA): Princeton University Press; Ciaran, D., David, M., (1992) Investment, Expectations and Uncertainty, , Oxford (UK): Blackwell Publishers; Yamamoto, Y., Tezuka, T., Optimal investment in power plant under price uncertainty (2002) Proceedings of the 41st SICE Annual Conference, pp. 1302-1305. , Osaka (Japan); Li, K.-H., Wang, X., Jiang, Y., Application of option theory in investment model of generation expansion planning (2003) Modern Electric Power, 20 (3-4), pp. 129-132; Min, K.J., Wang, C.H., Generation planning for inter-related generation units: A real options approach (2000) Proceedings of 2000 IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting, pp. 2261-2265. , Seattle (WA, USA); Audun, B., Magnus, K., Modeling of power generation investment incentives under uncertainty in liberalized electricity markets http://www.saee.ch; Audun, B., Marija, D.I., Wangensteen, I., Optimization of generation investments under uncertainty in restructured power markets (2003) Proceedings of Intelligent System Application to Power System, , Lemnos (Greece); Wen, F.-S., Wu, F.-L., Ni, Y.-X., Generation capacity adequacy in the deregulated electricity market environment (2002) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 26 (10), pp. 16-22; Andrew, F., Cycles in competitive electricity markets: A simulation study of the western united states (1999) Energy Policy, 27 (11), pp. 637-658; Poonsaeng, V., Fetter, S., Marija, D.I., Dynamic investment in electricity markets and its impact on system reliability (2001), http://www.mit.edu, MIT EL 01-012WP; Chung, S.L., Ho, C.W., Pricing American options using Monte Carlo simulation http://www.ncu.edu.tw; Barraquand, J., Martineau, D., Numerical valuation of high dimensional multivariate American securities (1995) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 30 (3), pp. 383-405; Inks, D.M.M., A real options approach to network expansion (2002), Doctoral Dissertation.

The tactful pricing of generation companies will be harmful to the security and economical operation of power system. Based on the mechanism design theory, an incentive mechanism considering contract was put forward in this paper. The mechanism is able to inspirit the generation companies to bid the true cost effectively and carry out economical operation as well. Then it can attract the generation capacity investment and configure the social resource reasonably. The illustration demonstrates the new mechanism can more effectively inspirit the generation companies on, near or over the system marginal cost, and it is able to ensure reasonable capacity cost recovery and restrain the sudden huge profits of all generation companies.","Competitive bidding volume; Contract volume; Electricity market; Mechanism design","Contracts; Cost benefit analysis; Industrial economics; Competitive bidding volume; Contract volume; Electricity market; Generation companies; Mechanism design; Electric power systems","Tang, Z., Tang, G., Yu, E., Power market dynamic analysis (2001) Proceedings of the CSEE, 21 (12), pp. 88-92; Bai, L., Kang, C., Xiao, Q., Analysis on the uncertainty of electricity price (2002) Proceedings of the CSEE, 22 (5), pp. 36-41; Chen, Y., Hou, Z., The study of the saturation phenomenon of spot price in electric power market (2004) Proceedings of the CSEE, 24 (3), pp. 51-55; Contreras, J., Candiles, O., de la Fuente, J.I., Auction design in day-ahead electricity markets (Republished) (2001) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 16 (3), pp. 409-417; Gan, D., Wang, J., Hu, Z., Auction games in pool-based electricity markets: Singles-period case (2003) Proceedings of the CSEE, 23 (6), pp. 71-76+86; Arroyo, J.M., Conejo, A.J., Multiperiod auction for a pool-based electricity market (2002) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 17 (4), pp. 1225-1231; Wang, X., Block bidding model based power market (2001) Proceedings of the CSEE, 21 (12), pp. 1-6; Zhao, J., Kang, C., Shang, J., Electricity trading model by group bidding (2003) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 27 (1), pp. 16-19+26; Wu, Z., Pan, L., Chen, H., Sensitivity based analysis method and algorithm for generation bidding (2004) Proceedings of the CSEE, 24 (1), pp. 60-64; Chen, H., Wang, X., Wang, X., Auction theory and its application in electricity market auction design - Part two application of auction theory in electricity market auction design (2003) Automation of Electric Power Systems, 27 (4), pp. 17-23+32; Guan, X., Ho, Y.-C., David, L.P., Gaming and price spikes in electric power markets (2001) IEEE Trans on Power Systems, 16 (3), pp. 402-408; Kahn, A.E., Cramton, P.C., Porter, R.H., Uniform pricing or pay-as-bid pricing: A dilemma for California and beyond (2001) The Electricity Journal, 14 (6), pp. 70-79; Fang, Y., Li, Y., Research on modeling the incentive electricity bidding mechanism of reasonable capacity cost recovery (2004) Proceedings of the CSEE, 24 (1), pp. 18-23; Silva, C.S., Wollenberg, B.F., Zheng, C.Z., Application of mechanism design to electric power markets (Republished) (2001) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 16 (4), pp. 862-869; Oren, S.S., Capacity payments and supply adequacy in competitive electricity markets (2002) Proceeding of VII Symposium of Specialists in Electric Operational and Expansion Planning, , http://www.pserc.wise.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/2000public/","Jiang, D.-R.; School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China",,,02588013,,ZDGXE,,"Chinese","Zhongguo Dianji Gongcheng Xuebao",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-27944475599

We show that if consumers and investors are risk averse, investment is efficient only if investors in generation capacity can sign long-term contracts with consumers. Otherwise the uncovered price risk increases financing costs, reduces equilibrium investment levels, distorts technology choice towards less capital-intensive generation and reduces consumer utility. We observe insufficient levels of long-term contracts in existing markets, possibly because retail companies are not credible counter-parties if their final customers can switch easily between them.

The paper focuses on the following issues related to the plan: Price reform; restructuring of regional energos and large generating companies; restructuring of transmission and system operation; the mechanism for introducing competition; competition for residential consumers; and reform sequencing. One key message of the paper is that price and regulatory reform is central to success of market liberalisation. A second key message is that the restructuring of energos should not create companies with market power. Ideally, local generation and distribution companies would be owned separately with multiple generators in each region. At a minimum, commonly owned companies should keep separate accounts, with regulation of generation a possibility where there is market power. Regarding transmission and dispatch, common ownership would not be a problem given that transmission and generation are separately owned. On competition, a fully fledged pool may not be appropriate in the case of Russia, with the alternative of a market based on bilateral contracts with a balancing pool functioning better in a context of non-payment and constrained institutional capacity, and providing security for investments. Regarding competition for residential consumers, this is not a priority in the short to medium term. Lastly, on sequencing, it is better that structural and institutional change takes place before competition begins. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Although ideally the market itself should be enough to provide adequate investment incentives, there are several factors that prevent this result from being achieved, and some actual markets have already experienced problems related with a lack of generation capacity. A regulatory framework to address this question is presented. The procedure is based on an organized market where reliability contracts (based on financial call options) are auctioned, so both their price and their allocation among the different plants are determined through competitive mechanisms. This results in a stabilization of the income of the generators and provides a clear incentive for new generation investment, with a minimum of regulatory intervention. Additionally, the method represents a market-compatible mechanism to hedge demand from the occurrence of high market prices.","Capacity markets; Capacity payments; Electricity markets; Generation adequacy; Long-term guarantee of supply; Wholesale market design","Costs; Electric generators; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Investments; Electricity markets; Electric power supplies to apparatus","Perez-Arriaga, I.J., Reliability in the new market structure (1999) IEEE Power Eng.
